# Building-a-Simple-Generative-Model
We will be discussing building and training a single-layer LSTM model for a character-level language model. The model is trained using PyTorch and is capable of generating new text based on a given prompt. Providing a step-by-step explanation of its functionality
The code is in Team Trinity jupyter notebook.
