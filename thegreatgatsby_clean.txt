In  younger   vulnerable years  father gave   advice
 I’  turning    mind ever since.

“Whenever  feel like criticizing anyone,”  told , “
remember    people   world ’   advantages

He ’ say  ,  ’ always  unusually communicative

 . In consequence, I’ inclined  reserve  judgements,

feigned sleep, preoccupation,   hostile levity  I realized 
 unmistakable sign   intimate revelation  quivering 
 horizon;   intimate revelations  young men,   least
 terms    express ,  usually plagiaristic 
marred  obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements   matter 
infinite hope. I  still  little afraid  missing something  I
forget ,   father snobbishly suggested,  I snobbishly
repeat,  sense   fundamental decencies  parcelled 
unequally  birth.

And,  boasting  way   tolerance, I come   admission

 world    uniform    sort  moral attention forever; I
wanted   riotous excursions  privileged glimpses

exempt   reaction—Gatsby,  represented everything   I

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My family   prominent, well-- people   Middle
Western city  three generations. The Carraways  something  
clan,     tradition  ’ descended   Dukes 
Buccleuch,   actual founder   line   grandfather’
brother,  came   fifty-one, sent  substitute   Civil
War,  started  wholesale hardware business   father
carries  today.

I never saw  great-uncle,  I’ supposed  look like —
special reference   rather hard-boiled painting  hangs 
father’ office. I graduated  New Haven  1915,   quarter 
 century   father,   little later I participated  
delayed Teutonic migration known   Great War. I enjoyed 
counter-raid  thoroughly  I came back restless. Instead  
 warm centre   world,  Middle West  seemed like 
ragged edge   universe— I decided  go East  learn  bond
business. Everybody I knew    bond business,  I supposed 
could support one  single man. All  aunts  uncles talked 
     choosing  prep school  ,  finally said,
“Why—ye-es,”   grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed  finance
   year,   various delays I came East, permanently, I
thought,   spring  twenty-two.

The practical thing   find rooms   city,     warm
season,  I   left  country  wide lawns  friendly
trees,    young man   office suggested   take 
house together   commuting town,  sounded like  great idea. He
found  house,  weather-beaten cardboard bungalow  eighty 
month,    last minute  firm ordered   Washington, 
I went    country alone. I   dog— least I    
 days   ran away—  old Dodge   Finnish woman, 
made  bed  cooked breakfast  muttered Finnish wisdom 
   electric stove.

It  lonely   day    one morning  man, 
recently arrived  I, stopped    road.

“How   get  West Egg village?”  asked helplessly.

I told . And  I walked  I  lonely  longer. I   guide,
 pathfinder,  original settler. He  casually conferred   
freedom   neighbourhood.

And    sunshine   great bursts  leaves growing  
trees,   things grow  fast movies, I   familiar
conviction  life  beginning     summer.

There   much  read,  one thing,   much fine health 
 pulled     young breath-giving air. I bought  dozen
volumes  banking  credit  investment securities,  
stood   shelf  red  gold like new money   mint,
promising  unfold  shining secrets   Midas  Morgan 
Maecenas knew. And I   high intention  reading many 
books besides. I  rather literary  college—one year I wrote 
series   solemn  obvious editorials   Yale News— 
I  going  bring back   things   life  become
   limited   specialists,  “well-rounded man.”
This ’   epigram—life  much  successfully looked 
  single window,  .

It   matter  chance  I   rented  house  one 
 strangest communities  North America. It    slender
riotous island  extends  due east  New York— 
 , among  natural curiosities, two unusual formations 
land. Twenty miles   city  pair  enormous eggs, identical 
contour  separated    courtesy bay, jut    
domesticated body  salt water   Western hemisphere,  great
wet barnyard  Long Island Sound. They   perfect ovals—like 
egg   Columbus story,    crushed flat   contact
end—  physical resemblance must   source  perpetual
wonder   gulls  fly overhead. To  wingless  
interesting phenomenon   dissimilarity  every particular
except shape  size.

I lived  West Egg, —well,  less fashionable   two, though
    superficial tag  express  bizarre    little
sinister contrast  . My house     tip  
egg,  fifty yards   Sound,  squeezed  two huge
places  rented  twelve  fifteen thousand  season. The one 
 right   colossal affair   standard—   factual
imitation   Hôtel de Ville  Normandy,   tower  one
side, spanking new   thin beard  raw ivy,   marble
swimming pool,    forty acres  lawn  garden. It 
Gatsby’ mansion. Or, rather,  I ’ know Mr. Gatsby,   
mansion inhabited   gentleman   name. My  house  
eyesore,     small eyesore,     overlooked,  I
  view   water,  partial view   neighbour’ lawn, 
 consoling proximity  millionaires—  eighty dollars 
month.

Across  courtesy bay  white palaces  fashionable East Egg
glittered along  water,   history   summer really begins
  evening I drove     dinner   Tom
Buchanans. Daisy   second cousin  removed,  I’ known Tom
 college. And    war I spent two days   
Chicago.

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,   one 
  powerful ends  ever played football  New Haven—
national figure   way, one   men  reach   acute
limited excellence  twenty-one  everything afterward savours 
anticlimax. His family  enormously wealthy—even  college 
freedom  money   matter  reproach—  ’ left Chicago
 come East   fashion  rather took  breath away: 
instance, ’ brought   string  polo ponies  Lake
Forest. It  hard  realize   man    generation 
wealthy enough   .

Why  came East I ’ know. They  spent  year  France 
 particular reason,   drifted    unrestfully
wherever people played polo   rich together. This  
permanent move, said Daisy   telephone,  I ’ believe
—I   sight  Daisy’ heart,  I felt  Tom would drift
 forever seeking,  little wistfully,   dramatic turbulence 
 irrecoverable football game.

And   happened    warm windy evening I drove   East
Egg  see two old friends  I scarcely knew  . Their house
 even  elaborate  I expected,  cheerful red--white
Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking  bay. The lawn started 
 beach  ran towards  front door   quarter   mile,
jumping  sundials  brick walks  burning gardens—finally 
 reached  house drifting   side  bright vines  though
  momentum   run. The front  broken   line  French
windows, glowing   reflected gold  wide open   warm
windy afternoon,  Tom Buchanan  riding clothes  standing 
 legs apart   front porch.

He  changed since  New Haven years. Now    sturdy
straw-haired man  thirty,   rather hard mouth  
supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes  established
dominance   face  gave   appearance  always leaning
aggressively forward. Not even  effeminate swank   riding
clothes could hide  enormous power   body— seemed  fill
 glistening boots   strained  top lacing,   could
see  great pack  muscle shifting   shoulder moved  
thin coat. It   body capable  enormous leverage— cruel body.

His speaking voice,  gruff husky tenor, added   impression 
fractiousness  conveyed. There   touch  paternal contempt 
, even toward people  liked—   men  New Haven 
 hated  guts.

“Now, ’ think  opinion   matters  final,”  seemed 
say, “  I’ stronger     man   .” We
    senior society,     never intimate I
always   impression   approved    wanted   like
   harsh, defiant wistfulness   .

We talked    minutes   sunny porch.

“I’ got  nice place ,”  said,  eyes flashing 
restlessly.

Turning  around  one arm,  moved  broad flat hand along 
front vista, including   sweep  sunken Italian garden,  half
acre  deep, pungent roses,   snub-nosed motorboat  bumped
 tide offshore.

“It belonged  Demaine,  oil man.” He turned  around ,
politely  abruptly. “We’ go inside.”

We walked   high hallway   bright rosy-coloured space,
fragilely bound   house  French windows  either end. The
windows  ajar  gleaming white   fresh grass outside
 seemed  grow  little way   house. A breeze blew 
 room, blew curtains   one end     like pale
flags, twisting   toward  frosted wedding-cake  
ceiling,   rippled   wine-coloured rug, making  shadow
   wind    sea.

The  completely stationary object   room   enormous
couch   two young women  buoyed   though upon 
anchored balloon. They    white,   dresses 
rippling  fluttering       blown back   
short flight around  house. I must  stood    moments
listening   whip  snap   curtains   groan  
picture   wall. Then    boom  Tom Buchanan shut 
rear windows   caught wind died    room,  
curtains   rugs   two young women ballooned slowly  
floor.

The younger   two   stranger  . She  extended full
length   end   divan, completely motionless,   
chin raised  little,     balancing something   
 quite likely  fall. If  saw     corner   eyes
 gave  hint  —indeed, I  almost surprised  murmuring
 apology   disturbed   coming .

The  girl, Daisy, made  attempt  rise— leaned slightly
forward   conscientious expression—  laughed,  absurd,
charming little laugh,  I laughed   came forward  
room.

“I’ p-paralysed  happiness.”

She laughed ,    said something  witty,  held 
hand   moment, looking    face, promising   
 one   world   much wanted  see. That   way 
. She hinted   murmur   surname   balancing girl 
Baker. (I’ heard  said  Daisy’ murmur    make people
lean toward ;  irrelevant criticism  made   less
charming.)

At  rate, Miss Baker’ lips fluttered,  nodded   almost
imperceptibly,   quickly tipped  head back — object
  balancing  obviously tottered  little  given 
something   fright. Again  sort  apology arose   lips.
Almost  exhibition  complete self-sufficiency draws  stunned
tribute  .

I looked back   cousin,  began  ask  questions   low,
thrilling voice. It   kind  voice   ear follows  
,    speech   arrangement  notes   never 
played . Her face  sad  lovely  bright things  ,
bright eyes   bright passionate mouth,     excitement
  voice  men   cared   found difficult  forget:
 singing compulsion,  whispered “Listen,”  promise   
done gay, exciting things    since     gay,
exciting things hovering   next hour.

I told   I  stopped   Chicago   day   way East,
   dozen people  sent  love  .

“Do  miss ?”  cried ecstatically.

“The whole town  desolate. All  cars   left rear wheel
painted black   mourning wreath,  ’  persistent wail 
night along  north shore.”

“How gorgeous! Let’ go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then  added
irrelevantly: “You ought  see  baby.”

“I’ like .”

“She’ asleep. She’ three years old. Haven’  ever seen ?”

“Never.”

“Well,  ought  see . She’—”

Tom Buchanan,    hovering restlessly   room, stopped
 rested  hand   shoulder.

“What  , Nick?”

“I’  bond man.”

“Who ?”

I told .

“Never heard  ,”  remarked decisively.

This annoyed .

“You ,” I answered shortly. “You    stay   East.”

“Oh, I’ stay   East, ’  worry,”  said, glancing 
Daisy   back  ,     alert  something
. “I’   God damned fool  live anywhere else.”

At  point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!”   suddenness 
I started—   first word   uttered since I came  
room. Evidently  surprised   much    ,   yawned
   series  rapid, deft movements stood    room.

“I’ stiff,”  complained, “I’  lying   sofa   long
 I  remember.”

“Don’ look  ,” Daisy retorted, “I’  trying  get  
New York  afternoon.”

“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker   four cocktails    
pantry. “I’ absolutely  training.”

Her host looked   incredulously.

“You !” He took   drink      drop   bottom
  glass. “How  ever get anything done  beyond .”

I looked  Miss Baker, wondering     “got done.” I
enjoyed looking  . She   slender, small-breasted girl, 
 erect carriage,   accentuated  throwing  body backward
  shoulders like  young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked
back    polite reciprocal curiosity    wan, charming,
discontented face. It occurred     I  seen ,  
picture  , somewhere .

“You live  West Egg,”  remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody
.”

“I ’ know  single—”

“You must know Gatsby.”

“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”

Before I could reply     neighbour dinner  announced;
wedging  tense arm imperatively  mine, Tom Buchanan compelled
   room  though   moving  checker  another square.

Slenderly, languidly,  hands set lightly   hips,  two
young women preceded us     rosy-coloured porch, open toward
 sunset,  four candles flickered   table  
diminished wind.

“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped    
fingers. “In two weeks ’   longest day   year.” She
looked  us  radiantly. “Do  always watch   longest day
  year   miss ? I always watch   longest day 
 year   miss .”

“We ought  plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting   
table     getting  bed.

“All right,” said Daisy. “What’  plan?” She turned  
helplessly: “What  people plan?”

Before I could answer  eyes fastened   awed expression  
little finger.

“Look!”  complained; “I hurt .”

We  looked— knuckle  black  blue.

“You  , Tom,”  said accusingly. “I know  ’ mean ,
    . That’  I get  marrying  brute   man, 
great, big, hulking physical specimen  —”

“I hate  word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even 
kidding.”

“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.

Sometimes   Miss Baker talked  , unobtrusively   
bantering inconsequence   never quite chatter,    cool
  white dresses   impersonal eyes   absence  
desire. They  ,   accepted Tom  , making  
polite pleasant effort  entertain    entertained. They knew
 presently dinner would     little later  evening 
would    casually put away. It  sharply different  
West,   evening  hurried  phase  phase towards 
close,   continually disappointed anticipation  else  sheer
nervous dread   moment .

“You make  feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed   second glass
 corky  rather impressive claret. “Can’  talk  crops 
something?”

I meant nothing  particular   remark,    taken  
 unexpected way.

“Civilization’ going  pieces,” broke  Tom violently. “I’
gotten    terrible pessimist  things. Have  read The Rise
  Coloured Empires   man Goddard?”

“Why, ,” I answered, rather surprised   tone.

“Well, ’  fine book,  everybody ought  read . The idea 
  ’ look   white race  —  utterly
submerged. It’  scientific stuff; ’  proved.”

“Tom’ getting  profound,” said Daisy,   expression 
unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books  long words 
. What   word —”

“Well,  books   scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing  
impatiently. “This fellow  worked   whole thing. It’  
us,    dominant race,  watch     races 
 control  things.”

“We’ got  beat  ,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously
toward  fervent sun.

“You ought  live  California—” began Miss Baker,  Tom
interrupted   shifting heavily   chair.

“This idea   ’ Nordics. I ,   ,   ,
—” After  infinitesimal hesitation  included Daisy  
slight nod,   winked   . “—And ’ produced  
things  go  make civilization—oh, science  art,  
. Do  see?”

There  something pathetic   concentration,   
complacency,  acute   old,   enough    .
When, almost immediately,  telephone rang inside   butler
left  porch Daisy seized upon  momentary interruption  leaned
towards .

“I’ tell   family secret,”  whispered enthusiastically.
“It’   butler’ nose. Do  want  hear   butler’
nose?”

“That’  I came  tonight.”

“Well,  ’ always  butler;  used    silver polisher
  people  New York    silver service  two hundred
people. He   polish   morning till night,  finally 
began  affect  nose—”

“Things went  bad  worse,” suggested Miss Baker.

“Yes. Things went  bad  worse,  finally    give 
 position.”

For  moment  last sunshine fell  romantic affection upon 
glowing face;  voice compelled  forward breathlessly  I
listened—  glow faded,  light deserting   lingering
regret, like children leaving  pleasant street  dusk.

The butler came back  murmured something close  Tom’ ear,
whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back  chair,  without  word went
inside. As   absence quickened something within , Daisy leaned
forward ,  voice glowing  singing.

“I love  see    table, Nick. You remind   —  rose, 
absolute rose. Doesn’ ?” She turned  Miss Baker  confirmation:
“An absolute rose?”

This  untrue. I   even faintly like  rose. She  
extemporizing,   stirring warmth flowed  ,    heart
 trying  come    concealed  one   breathless,
thrilling words. Then suddenly  threw  napkin   table 
excused   went   house.

Miss Baker  I exchanged  short glance consciously devoid 
meaning. I    speak   sat  alertly  said “Sh!”
  warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur  audible  
room beyond,  Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying 
hear. The murmur trembled   verge  coherence, sank ,
mounted excitedly,   ceased altogether.

“This Mr. Gatsby  spoke    neighbour—” I began.

“Don’ talk. I want  hear  happens.”

“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.

“You mean  say  ’ know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.
“I thought everybody knew.”

“I ’.”

“Why—”  said hesitantly. “Tom’ got  woman  New York.”

“Got  woman?” I repeated blankly.

Miss Baker nodded.

“She might   decency   telephone   dinner time.
Don’  think?”

Almost  I  grasped  meaning    flutter  
dress   crunch  leather boots,  Tom  Daisy  back 
 table.

“It ’  helped!” cried Daisy  tense gaiety.

She sat , glanced searchingly  Miss Baker    , 
continued: “I looked outdoors   minute,  ’  romantic
outdoors. There’  bird   lawn  I think must  
nightingale come    Cunard  White Star Line. He’ singing
away—” Her voice sang: “It’ romantic, ’ , Tom?”

“Very romantic,”  said,   miserably  : “If ’ light
enough  dinner, I want  take     stables.”

The telephone rang inside, startlingly,   Daisy shook  head
decisively  Tom  subject   stables,  fact  subjects,
vanished  air. Among  broken fragments   last five minutes
 table I remember  candles  lit , pointlessly,  I
 conscious  wanting  look squarely  everyone,  yet 
avoid  eyes. I ’ guess  Daisy  Tom  thinking, 
I doubt  even Miss Baker,  seemed   mastered  certain
hardy scepticism,  able utterly  put  fifth guest’ shrill
metallic urgency   mind. To  certain temperament  situation
might  seemed intriguing—  instinct   telephone
immediately   police.

The horses, needless  say,   mentioned . Tom  Miss
Baker,  several feet  twilight  , strolled back 
 library,     vigil beside  perfectly tangible body, ,
trying  look pleasantly interested   little deaf, I followed
Daisy around  chain  connecting verandas   porch  front. In
 deep gloom  sat  side  side   wicker settee.

Daisy took  face   hands   feeling  lovely shape, 
 eyes moved gradually    velvet dusk. I saw 
turbulent emotions possessed ,  I asked  I thought would 
 sedative questions   little girl.

“We ’ know    well, Nick,”  said suddenly. “Even
   cousins. You ’ come   wedding.”

“I ’ back   war.”

“That’ true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’    bad time, Nick,
 I’ pretty cynical  everything.”

Evidently   reason  . I waited   ’ say  ,
   moment I returned rather feebly   subject  
daughter.

“I suppose  talks, —eats,  everything.”

“Oh, yes.” She looked   absently. “Listen, Nick; let  tell 
 I said    born. Would  like  hear?”

“Very much.”

“It’ show   I’ gotten  feel —things. Well,  
less   hour old  Tom  God knows . I woke   
 ether   utterly abandoned feeling,  asked  nurse right
away     boy   girl. She told     girl,   I
turned  head away  wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’ glad ’ 
girl. And I hope ’   fool—’  best thing  girl  
  world,  beautiful little fool.’

“You see I think everything’ terrible anyhow,”  went   
convinced way. “Everybody thinks —  advanced people. And I
know. I’  everywhere  seen everything  done everything.”
Her eyes flashed around    defiant way, rather like Tom’, 
 laughed  thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’
sophisticated!”

The instant  voice broke , ceasing  compel  attention, 
belief, I felt  basic insincerity     said. It made 
uneasy,  though  whole evening    trick   sort 
exact  contributory emotion  . I waited,  sure enough,  
moment  looked     absolute smirk   lovely face, 
   asserted  membership   rather distinguished secret
society     Tom belonged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside,  crimson room bloomed  light. Tom  Miss Baker sat 
either end   long couch   read aloud    
Saturday Evening Post— words, murmurous  uninflected, running
together   soothing tune. The lamplight, bright   boots 
dull   autumn-leaf yellow   hair, glinted along  paper 
 turned  page   flutter  slender muscles   arms.

When  came   held us silent   moment   lifted hand.

“To  continued,”  said, tossing  magazine   table, “
  next issue.”

Her body asserted    restless movement   knee,  
stood .

“Ten ’clock,”  remarked, apparently finding  time  
ceiling. “Time   good girl  go  bed.”

“Jordan’ going  play   tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,
“  Westchester.”

“Oh—’ Jordan Baker.”

I knew    face  familiar— pleasing contemptuous
expression  looked     many rotogravure pictures  
sporting life  Asheville  Hot Springs  Palm Beach. I  heard
 story   ,  critical, unpleasant story,     I
 forgotten long ago.

“Good night,”  said softly. “Wake   eight, ’ .”

“If ’ get .”

“I . Good night, Mr. Carraway. See  anon.”

“Of course  ,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ arrange 
marriage. Come  often, Nick,  I’ sort —oh—fling 
together. You know—lock   accidentally  linen closets  push
   sea   boat,    sort  thing—”

“Good night,” called Miss Baker   stairs. “I ’ heard 
word.”

“She’  nice girl,” said Tom   moment. “They oughtn’  let
 run around  country  way.”

“Who oughtn’ ?” inquired Daisy coldly.

“Her family.”

“Her family  one aunt   thousand years old. Besides, Nick’
going  look  , ’ , Nick? She’ going  spend lots
 weekends    summer. I think  home influence  
 good  .”

Daisy  Tom looked      moment  silence.

“Is   New York?” I asked quickly.

“From Louisville. Our white girlhood  passed together . Our
beautiful white—”

“Did  give Nick  little heart  heart talk   veranda?”
demanded Tom suddenly.

“Did I?” She looked  . “I ’ seem  remember,  I think 
talked   Nordic race. Yes, I’ sure  . It sort  crept
  us  first thing  know—”

“Don’ believe everything  hear, Nick,”  advised .

I said lightly  I  heard nothing  ,    minutes
later I got   go home. They came   door    stood
side  side   cheerful square  light. As I started  motor
Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”

“I forgot  ask  something,  ’ important. We heard  
engaged   girl  West.”

“That’ right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard   
engaged.”

“It’  libel. I’  poor.”

“But  heard ,” insisted Daisy, surprising   opening  
  flower-like way. “We heard   three people,   must 
true.”

Of course I knew    referring ,  I ’ even
vaguely engaged. The fact  gossip  published  banns  one
  reasons I  come East. You ’ stop going   old
friend  account  rumours,     hand I   intention
  rumoured  marriage.

Their interest rather touched   made  less remotely
rich—nevertheless, I  confused   little disgusted  I drove
away. It seemed     thing  Daisy     rush 
  house, child  arms— apparently    
intentions   head. As  Tom,  fact   “  woman
 New York”  really less surprising     
depressed   book. Something  making  nibble   edge 
stale ideas    sturdy physical egotism  longer nourished 
peremptory heart.

Already   deep summer  roadhouse roofs   front  wayside
garages,  new red petrol-pumps sat   pools  light, 
 I reached  estate  West Egg I ran  car   shed 
sat      abandoned grass roller   yard. The wind 
blown , leaving  loud, bright night,  wings beating  
trees   persistent organ sound   full bellows   earth
blew  frogs full  life. The silhouette   moving cat wavered
across  moonlight, , turning  head  watch , I saw  I
  alone—fifty feet away  figure  emerged   shadow 
 neighbour’ mansion   standing   hands   pockets
regarding  silver pepper   stars. Something   leisurely
movements   secure position   feet upon  lawn suggested
   Mr. Gatsby , come   determine  share 
   local heavens.

I decided  call  . Miss Baker  mentioned   dinner, 
 would    introduction. But I ’ call  ,  
gave  sudden intimation    content   alone— stretched
  arms toward  dark water   curious way, , far  I 
 , I could  sworn   trembling. Involuntarily I glanced
seaward— distinguished nothing except  single green light, minute
 far away,  might    end   dock. When I looked
   Gatsby   vanished,  I  alone   
unquiet darkness.


                                  II

About halfway  West Egg  New York  motor road hastily
joins  railroad  runs beside    quarter   mile,  
 shrink away   certain desolate area  land. This   valley
 ashes— fantastic farm  ashes grow like wheat  ridges 
hills  grotesque gardens;  ashes take  forms  houses 
chimneys  rising smoke , finally,   transcendent effort, 
ash-grey men,  move dimly  already crumbling   powdery
air. Occasionally  line  grey cars crawls along  invisible track,
gives   ghastly creak,  comes  rest,  immediately 
ash-grey men swarm   leaden spades  stir   impenetrable
cloud,  screens  obscure operations   sight.

But   grey land   spasms  bleak dust  drift
endlessly  ,  perceive,   moment,  eyes  Doctor T.
J. Eckleburg. The eyes  Doctor T. J. Eckleburg  blue 
gigantic— retinas  one yard high. They look    face,
, instead,   pair  enormous yellow spectacles  pass
  nonexistent nose. Evidently  wild wag   oculist set
   fatten  practice   borough  Queens,  
sank    eternal blindness,  forgot   moved
away. But  eyes, dimmed  little  many paintless days,  sun
 rain, brood    solemn dumping ground.

The valley  ashes  bounded  one side   small foul river, ,
  drawbridge    let barges ,  passengers 
waiting trains  stare   dismal scene   long  half 
hour. There  always  halt    least  minute,   
    I first met Tom Buchanan’ mistress.

The fact    one  insisted upon wherever   known. His
acquaintances resented  fact   turned   popular cafés
  , leaving    table, sauntered , chatting 
whomsoever  knew. Though I  curious  see , I   desire
 meet — I . I went   New York  Tom   train one
afternoon,    stopped   ash-heaps  jumped   feet
, taking hold   elbow, literally forced    car.

“We’ getting ,”  insisted. “I want   meet  girl.”

I think ’ tanked   good deal  luncheon,   determination
   company bordered  violence. The supercilious assumption
   Sunday afternoon I  nothing better  .

I followed    low whitewashed railroad fence,   walked
back  hundred yards along  road  Doctor Eckleburg’
persistent stare. The  building  sight   small block 
yellow brick sitting   edge   waste land,  sort  compact
Main Street ministering  ,  contiguous  absolutely nothing.
One   three shops  contained   rent  another  
-night restaurant, approached   trail  ashes;  third  
garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought  sold.— I followed
Tom inside.

The interior  unprosperous  bare;   car visible  
dust-covered wreck   Ford  crouched   dim corner. It 
occurred     shadow   garage must   blind,  
sumptuous  romantic apartments  concealed overhead,  
proprietor  appeared   door   office, wiping  hands
  piece  waste. He   blond, spiritless man, anaemic, 
faintly handsome. When  saw us  damp gleam  hope sprang  
light blue eyes.

“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping  jovially  
shoulder. “How’ business?”

“I ’ complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When  
going  sell   car?”

“Next week; I’ got  man working   .”

“Works pretty slow, ’ ?”

“No,  ’,” said Tom coldly. “And   feel  way  ,
maybe I’ better sell  somewhere else  .”

“I ’ mean ,” explained Wilson quickly. “I  meant—”

His voice faded   Tom glanced impatiently around  garage.
Then I heard footsteps   stairs,    moment  thickish
figure   woman blocked   light   office door. She 
  middle thirties,  faintly stout,   carried  flesh
sensuously   women . Her face,   spotted dress  dark
blue crêpe-de-chine, contained  facet  gleam  beauty,  
  immediately perceptible vitality      nerves 
 body  continually smouldering. She smiled slowly , walking
  husband      ghost, shook hands  Tom,
looking  flush   eye. Then  wet  lips,  without
turning around spoke   husband   soft, coarse voice:

“Get  chairs,  ’ ,  somebody  sit .”

“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly,  went toward  little
office, mingling immediately   cement colour   walls. A
white ashen dust veiled  dark suit   pale hair   veiled
everything   vicinity—except  wife,  moved close  Tom.

“I want  see ,” said Tom intently. “Get   next train.”

“All right.”

“I’ meet    newsstand   lower level.”

She nodded  moved away     George Wilson emerged 
two chairs   office door.

We waited     road    sight. It    days
  Fourth  July,   grey, scrawny Italian child 
setting torpedoes   row along  railroad track.

“Terrible place, ’ ,” said Tom, exchanging  frown  Doctor
Eckleburg.

“Awful.”

“It   good  get away.”

“Doesn’  husband object?”

“Wilson? He thinks  goes  see  sister  New York. He’ 
dumb  ’ know ’ alive.”

So Tom Buchanan   girl  I went  together  New York— 
quite together,  Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly  another car. Tom
deferred  much   sensibilities   East Eggers  might
   train.

She  changed  dress   brown figured muslin,  stretched
tight   rather wide hips  Tom helped    platform 
New York. At  newsstand  bought  copy  Town Tattle  
moving-picture magazine,    station drugstore  cold cream
  small flask  perfume. Upstairs,   solemn echoing drive
 let four taxicabs drive away   selected  new one,
lavender-coloured  grey upholstery,     slid  
 mass   station   glowing sunshine. But immediately 
turned sharply   window , leaning forward, tapped  
front glass.

“I want  get one   dogs,”  said earnestly. “I want  get
one   apartment. They’ nice  — dog.”

We backed    grey old man  bore  absurd resemblance  John
D. Rockefeller. In  basket swung   neck cowered  dozen 
recent puppies   indeterminate breed.

“What kind  ?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly,   came  
taxi-window.

“All kinds. What kind   want, lady?”

“I’ like  get one   police dogs; I ’ suppose  got
 kind?”

The man peered doubtfully   basket, plunged   hand 
drew one , wriggling,   back   neck.

“That’  police dog,” said Tom.

“No, ’  exactly  police dog,” said  man  disappointment
  voice. “It’    Airedale.” He passed  hand  
brown washrag   back. “Look   coat. Some coat. That’  dog
’ never bother   catching cold.”

“I think ’ cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much 
?”

“That dog?” He looked   admiringly. “That dog  cost  ten
dollars.”

The Airedale—undoubtedly    Airedale concerned  
somewhere, though  feet  startlingly white—changed hands 
settled   Mrs. Wilson’ lap,   fondled 
weatherproof coat  rapture.

“Is   boy   girl?”  asked delicately.

“That dog? That dog’  boy.”

“It’  bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’  money. Go  buy
ten  dogs  .”

We drove   Fifth Avenue, warm  soft, almost pastoral,  
summer Sunday afternoon. I ’   surprised  see  great
flock  white sheep turn  corner.

“Hold ,” I said, “I   leave  .”

“No  ’,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’  hurt  
’ come    apartment. Won’ , Myrtle?”

“Come ,”  urged. “I’ telephone  sister Catherine. She’ said
   beautiful  people  ought  know.”

“Well, I’ like , —”

We went , cutting back    Park toward  West Hundreds.
At 158th Street  cab stopped  one slice   long white cake 
apartment-houses. Throwing  regal homecoming glance around 
neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered   dog   
purchases,  went haughtily .

“I’ going    McKees come ,”  announced   rose 
 elevator. “And,  course, I got  call   sister, .”

The apartment    top floor— small living-room,  small
dining-room,  small bedroom,   bath. The living-room  crowded
  doors   set  tapestried furniture entirely  large 
,    move    stumble continually  scenes 
ladies swinging   gardens  Versailles. The  picture  
-enlarged photograph, apparently  hen sitting   blurred rock.
Looked    distance, however,  hen resolved   
bonnet,   countenance   stout old lady beamed   
room. Several old copies  Town Tattle lay   table together 
 copy  Simon Called Peter,     small scandal magazines
 Broadway. Mrs. Wilson  first concerned   dog. A reluctant
elevator boy went   box full  straw   milk,   
added    initiative  tin  large, hard dog biscuits—one 
 decomposed apathetically   saucer  milk 
afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought   bottle  whisky   locked
bureau door.

I   drunk  twice   life,   second time  
afternoon;  everything  happened   dim, hazy cast  ,
although   eight ’clock  apartment  full  cheerful
sun. Sitting  Tom’ lap Mrs. Wilson called  several people  
telephone;     cigarettes,  I went   buy 
  drugstore   corner. When I came back   
disappeared,  I sat  discreetly   living-room  read 
chapter  Simon Called Peter—either   terrible stuff  
whisky distorted things,   ’ make  sense  .

Just  Tom  Myrtle (  first drink Mrs. Wilson  I called
    first names) reappeared, company commenced  arrive
  apartment door.

The sister, Catherine,   slender, worldly girl   thirty,
  solid, sticky bob  red hair,   complexion powdered milky
white. Her eyebrows   plucked   drawn     
rakish angle,   efforts  nature toward  restoration  
old alignment gave  blurred air   face. When  moved 
   incessant clicking  innumerable pottery bracelets
jingled    upon  arms. She came     proprietary
haste,  looked around  possessively   furniture  I
wondered   lived . But  I asked   laughed
immoderately, repeated  question aloud,  told   lived  
girl friend   hotel.

Mr. McKee   pale, feminine man   flat . He  
shaved,     white spot  lather   cheekbone,  
  respectful   greeting  everyone   room. He
informed       “artistic game,”  I gathered later
    photographer   made  dim enlargement 
Mrs. Wilson’ mother  hovered like  ectoplasm   wall. His
wife  shrill, languid, handsome,  horrible. She told  
pride   husband  photographed   hundred  twenty-seven
times since    married.

Mrs. Wilson  changed  costume  time ,   
attired   elaborate afternoon dress  cream-coloured chiffon,
 gave   continual rustle   swept   room. With
 influence   dress  personality  also undergone 
change. The intense vitality     remarkable   garage
 converted  impressive hauteur. Her laughter,  gestures, 
assertions became  violently affected moment  moment,   
expanded  room grew smaller around ,   seemed  
revolving   noisy, creaking pivot   smoky air.

“My dear,”  told  sister   high, mincing shout, “ 
 fellas  cheat  every time. All  think   money. I
  woman   last week  look   feet,    gave 
 bill ’  thought    appendicitis .”

“What   name   woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.

“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking  people’ feet   
homes.”

“I like  dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think ’ adorable.”

Mrs. Wilson rejected  compliment  raising  eyebrow  disdain.

“It’   crazy old thing,”  said. “I  slip   sometimes
 I ’ care  I look like.”

“But  looks wonderful  ,   know  I mean,” pursued Mrs.
McKee. “If Chester could  get    pose I think  could
make something  .”

We  looked  silence  Mrs. Wilson,  removed  strand  hair
   eyes  looked back  us   brilliant smile. Mr.
McKee regarded  intently   head  one side,   moved
 hand back  forth slowly  front   face.

“I  change  light,”  said   moment. “I’ like 
bring   modelling   features. And I’ try  get hold 
  back hair.”

“I ’ think  changing  light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think
’—”

Her husband said “Sh!”    looked   subject ,
whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly  got   feet.

“You McKees  something  drink,”  said. “Get   ice 
mineral water, Myrtle,  everybody goes  sleep.”

“I told  boy   ice.” Myrtle raised  eyebrows  despair
  shiftlessness   lower orders. “These people! You  
keep     time.”

She looked    laughed pointlessly. Then  flounced  
 dog, kissed   ecstasy,  swept   kitchen, implying
  dozen chefs awaited  orders .

“I’ done  nice things   Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.

Tom looked   blankly.

“Two     framed downstairs.”

“Two ?” demanded Tom.

“Two studies. One   I call Montauk Point—The Gulls,  
 I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”

The sister Catherine sat  beside    couch.

“Do  live   Long Island, ?”  inquired.

“I live  West Egg.”

“Really? I      party   month ago. At  man named
Gatsby’. Do  know ?”

“I live next door  .”

“Well,  say ’  nephew   cousin  Kaiser Wilhelm’. That’
   money comes .”

“Really?”

She nodded.

“I’ scared  . I’ hate    get anything  .”

This absorbing information   neighbour  interrupted  Mrs.
McKee’ pointing suddenly  Catherine:

“Chester, I think  could  something  ,”  broke , 
Mr. McKee  nodded   bored way,  turned  attention  Tom.

“I’ like    work  Long Island,  I could get  entry.
All I ask     give   start.”

“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking   short shout  laughter 
Mrs. Wilson entered   tray. “She’ give   letter 
introduction, ’ , Myrtle?”

“Do ?”  asked, startled.

“You’ give McKee  letter  introduction   husband,   
  studies  .” His lips moved silently   moment  
invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson   Gasoline Pump,’  something like
.”

Catherine leaned close    whispered   ear:

“Neither    stand  person ’ married .”

“Can’ ?”

“Can’ stand .” She looked  Myrtle    Tom. “What I say
,  go  living     ’ stand ? If I  
I’ get  divorce  get married    right away.”

“Doesn’  like Wilson either?”

The answer    unexpected. It came  Myrtle,  
overheard  question,    violent  obscene.

“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered  voice .
“It’ really  wife ’ keeping  apart. She’  Catholic, 
 ’ believe  divorce.”

Daisy    Catholic,  I   little shocked  
elaborateness   lie.

“When   get married,” continued Catherine, “’ going West
 live      blows .”

“It’   discreet  go  Europe.”

“Oh,   like Europe?”  exclaimed surprisingly. “I  got back
 Monte Carlo.”

“Really.”

“Just last year. I went    another girl.”

“Stay long?”

“No,   went  Monte Carlo  back. We went  way 
Marseilles. We   twelve hundred dollars   started,  
got gyped      two days   private rooms. We  
awful time getting back, I  tell . God,  I hated  town!”

The late afternoon sky bloomed   window   moment like 
blue honey   Mediterranean—  shrill voice  Mrs. McKee
called  back   room.

“I almost made  mistake, ,”  declared vigorously. “I almost
married  little kike ’     years. I knew  
 . Everybody kept saying  : ‘Lucille,  man’ way 
!’ But  I ’ met Chester, ’  got  sure.”

“Yes,  listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding  head   ,
“ least  ’ marry .”

“I know I ’.”

“Well, I married ,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And ’ 
difference   case  mine.”

“Why  , Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced  .”

Myrtle considered.

“I married   I thought    gentleman,”  said
finally. “I thought  knew something  breeding,   ’
fit  lick  shoe.”

“You  crazy     ,” said Catherine.

“Crazy  !” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I  crazy
 ? I never    crazy    I   
man .”

She pointed suddenly  ,  everyone looked   accusingly. I
tried  show   expression  I expected  affection.

“The  crazy I    I married . I knew right away I made
 mistake. He borrowed somebody’ best suit  get married , 
never even told   ,   man came   one day  
 : ‘Oh,    suit?’ I said. ‘This   first I ever
heard  .’ But I gave      I lay   cried 
beat  band  afternoon.”

“She really ought  get away  ,” resumed Catherine  .
“They’  living   garage  eleven years. And Tom’ 
first sweetie  ever .”

The bottle  whisky— second one—   constant demand  
present, excepting Catherine,  “felt   good  nothing 
.” Tom rang   janitor  sent    celebrated
sandwiches,    complete supper  . I wanted 
get   walk eastward toward  park   soft twilight,
  time I tried  go I became entangled   wild, strident
argument  pulled  back,    ropes,   chair. Yet
high   city  line  yellow windows must  contributed
 share  human secrecy   casual watcher   darkening
streets,  I saw  , looking   wondering. I  within 
without, simultaneously enchanted  repelled   inexhaustible
variety  life.

Myrtle pulled  chair close  mine,  suddenly  warm breath
poured    story   first meeting  Tom.

“It    two little seats facing     always 
last ones left   train. I  going   New York  see 
sister  spend  night. He    dress suit  patent leather
shoes,  I ’ keep  eyes  ,  every time  looked

 taxi   I ’ hardly know I ’ getting   subway
train. All I kept thinking ,   ,  ‘You ’ live
forever;  ’ live forever.’ ”

She turned  Mrs. McKee   room rang full   artificial
laughter.

“My dear,”  cried, “I’ going  give   dress  soon  I’
  . I’ got  get another one tomorrow. I’ going 
make  list    things I’ got  get. A massage   wave,
  collar   dog,  one   cute little ashtrays 
 touch  spring,   wreath   black silk bow  mother’
grave ’ last  summer. I got  write   list  I ’
forget   things I got  .”

It  nine ’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked   watch
 found   ten. Mr. McKee  asleep   chair   fists
clenched   lap, like  photograph   man  action. Taking 
 handkerchief I wiped   cheek  spot  dried lather 
 worried    afternoon.

The little dog  sitting   table looking  blind eyes
  smoke,   time  time groaning faintly. People
disappeared, reappeared, made plans  go somewhere,   lost
 , searched   , found     feet
away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan  Mrs. Wilson stood
face  face discussing,  impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson
  right  mention Daisy’ name.

“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ say  whenever I
want ! Daisy! Dai—”

Making  short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke  nose  
open hand.

Then   bloody towels upon  bathroom floor,  women’
voices scolding,  high   confusion  long broken wail 
pain. Mr. McKee awoke   doze  started   daze toward 
door. When   gone halfway  turned around  stared  
scene— wife  Catherine scolding  consoling   stumbled
   among  crowded furniture  articles  aid, 
 despairing figure   couch, bleeding fluently,  trying 
spread  copy  Town Tattle   tapestry scenes

Taking  hat   chandelier, I followed.

“Come  lunch  day,”  suggested,   groaned   
elevator.

“Where?”

“Anywhere.”

“Keep  hands   lever,” snapped  elevator boy.

“I beg  pardon,” said Mr. McKee  dignity, “I ’ know I 
touching .”

“All right,” I agreed, “I’  glad .”

… I  standing beside  bed    sitting

Then I  lying half asleep   cold lower level

There  music   neighbour’ house   summer nights.
In  blue gardens men  girls came  went like moths among

Every Friday five crates  oranges  lemons arrived

At least   fortnight  corps  caterers came   several

By seven ’clock  orchestra  arrived,  thin five-piece affair,

voices pitches  key higher. Laughter  easier minute  minute,
spilled  prodigality, tipped    cheerful word. The groups
change  swiftly, swell  new arrivals, dissolve  form  
 breath; already   wanderers, confident girls  weave
   among  stouter   stable, become   sharp,
joyous moment  centre   group,  , excited  triumph,
glide    sea-change  faces  voices  colour 
 constantly changing light.

Suddenly one   gypsies,  trembling opal, seizes  cocktail
   air, dumps    courage , moving  hands like
Frisco, dances  alone   canvas platform. A momentary hush; 
orchestra leader varies  rhythm obligingly  ,    
burst  chatter   erroneous news goes around    Gilda
Gray’ understudy   Follies. The party  begun.

I believe    first night I went  Gatsby’ house I  one
   guests   actually  invited. People  
invited— went . They got  automobiles  bore  
 Long Island,  somehow  ended   Gatsby’ door. Once 
  introduced  somebody  knew Gatsby,    
conducted  according   rules  behaviour associated
  amusement park. Sometimes  came  went without 
met Gatsby  , came   party   simplicity  heart 
   ticket  admission.

I   actually invited. A chauffeur   uniform  robin’-egg
blue crossed  lawn early  Saturday morning   surprisingly
formal note   employer:  honour would  entirely Gatsby’,
 said,  I would attend  “little party”  night. He  seen
 several times,   intended  call   long ,  
peculiar combination  circumstances  prevented —signed Jay
Gatsby,   majestic hand.

Dressed   white flannels I went    lawn  little 
seven,  wandered around rather ill  ease among swirls  eddies
 people I ’ know—though      face I  noticed
  commuting train. I  immediately struck   number 
young Englishmen dotted ;  well dressed,  looking  little
hungry,   talking  low, earnest voices  solid  prosperous
Americans. I  sure    selling something: bonds 
insurance  automobiles. They   least agonizingly aware  
easy money   vicinity  convinced       
words   right key.

As soon  I arrived I made  attempt  find  host,   two 
three people   I asked  whereabouts stared     
amazed way,  denied  vehemently  knowledge   movements,
 I slunk    direction   cocktail table—  place
  garden   single man could linger without looking
purposeless  alone.

I    way  get roaring drunk  sheer embarrassment 
Jordan Baker came    house  stood   head   marble
steps, leaning  little backward  looking  contemptuous
interest    garden.

Welcome  , I found  necessary  attach   someone
 I  begin  address cordial remarks   passersby.

“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward . My voice seemed unnaturally
loud across  garden.

“I thought  might  ,”  responded absently  I came .
“I remembered  lived next door —”

She held  hand impersonally,   promise  ’ take care  
  minute,  gave ear  two girls  twin yellow dresses, 
stopped   foot   steps.

“Hello!”  cried together. “Sorry  ’ win.”

That    golf tournament. She  lost   finals  week
.

“You ’ know   ,” said one   girls  yellow, “ 
met     month ago.”

“You’ dyed  hair since ,” remarked Jordan,  I started,
  girls  moved casually    remark  addressed 
 premature moon, produced like  supper,  doubt,   
caterer’ basket. With Jordan’ slender golden arm resting  mine, 
descended  steps  sauntered   garden. A tray 
cocktails floated  us   twilight,   sat   
table   two girls  yellow  three men,  one introduced
 us  Mr. Mumble.

“Do  come   parties often?” inquired Jordan   girl
beside .

“The last one   one I met  ,” answered  girl,  
alert confident voice. She turned   companion: “Wasn’  
, Lucille?”

It   Lucille, .

“I like  come,” Lucille said. “I never care  I ,  I always
  good time. When I   last I tore  gown   chair, 
 asked   name  address—inside   week I got  package 
Croirier’   new evening gown  .”

“Did  keep ?” asked Jordan.

“Sure I . I  going  wear  tonight,     big  
bust     altered. It  gas blue  lavender beads. Two
hundred  sixty-five dollars.”

“There’ something funny   fellow ’   thing like ,”
said   girl eagerly. “He ’ want  trouble 
anybody.”

“Who ’?” I inquired.

“Gatsby. Somebody told —”

The two girls  Jordan leaned together confidentially.

“Somebody told   thought  killed  man .”

A thrill passed    us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward 
listened eagerly.

“I ’ think ’  much ,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’
     German spy   war.”

One   men nodded  confirmation.

“I heard    man  knew   , grew    
Germany,”  assured us positively.

“Oh, ,” said  first girl, “ ’  ,    
 American army   war.” As  credulity switched back 
  leaned forward  enthusiasm. “You look   sometimes
  thinks nobody’ looking  . I’ bet  killed  man.”

She narrowed  eyes  shivered. Lucille shivered. We  turned
 looked around  Gatsby. It  testimony   romantic
speculation  inspired    whispers    
  found little    necessary  whisper   
world.

The first supper— would  another one  midnight— 
 served,  Jordan invited   join   party,  
spread around  table    side   garden. There 
three married couples  Jordan’ escort,  persistent undergraduate
given  violent innuendo,  obviously   impression 
sooner  later Jordan  going  yield    person  
greater  lesser degree. Instead  rambling,  party 
preserved  dignified homogeneity,  assumed    function
 representing  staid nobility   countryside—East Egg
condescending  West Egg  carefully  guard  
spectroscopic gaiety.

“Let’ get ,” whispered Jordan,   somehow wasteful 
inappropriate half-hour; “  much  polite  .”

We got ,   explained    going  find  host: I
 never met ,  said,    making  uneasy. The
undergraduate nodded   cynical, melancholy way.

The bar,   glanced first,  crowded,  Gatsby  
. She ’ find    top   steps,   ’
  veranda. On  chance  tried  important-looking door, 
walked   high Gothic library, panelled  carved English oak,
 probably transported complete   ruin overseas.

A stout, middle-aged man,  enormous owl-eyed spectacles, 
sitting somewhat drunk   edge   great table, staring 
unsteady concentration   shelves  books. As  entered 
wheeled excitedly around  examined Jordan  head  foot.

“What   think?”  demanded impetuously.

“About ?”

He waved  hand toward  bookshelves.

“About . As  matter  fact  ’ bother  ascertain. I
ascertained. They’ real.”

“The books?”

He nodded.

“Absolutely real— pages  everything. I thought ’   nice
durable cardboard. Matter  fact, ’ absolutely real.  Pages
—Here! Lemme show .”

Taking  scepticism  granted,  rushed   bookcases 
returned  Volume One   Stoddard Lectures.

“See!”  cried triumphantly. “It’  bona-fide piece  printed
matter. It fooled . This fella’  regular Belasco. It’ 
triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew   stop,
—’ cut  pages. But    want? What   expect?”

He snatched  book    replaced  hastily   shelf,
muttering   one brick  removed  whole library  liable
 collapse.

“Who brought ?”  demanded. “Or    come? I  brought.
Most people  brought.”

Jordan looked   alertly, cheerfully, without answering.

“I  brought   woman named Roosevelt,”  continued. “Mrs. Claud
Roosevelt. Do  know ? I met  somewhere last night. I’ 
drunk    week ,  I thought  might sober    sit
  library.”

“Has ?”

“A little bit, I think. I ’ tell yet. I’     hour.
Did I tell    books? They’ real. They’—”

“You told us.”

We shook hands   gravely  went back outdoors.

There  dancing    canvas   garden; old men pushing
young girls backward  eternal graceless circles, superior couples
holding   tortuously, fashionably,  keeping  
corners—  great number  single girls dancing individually 
relieving  orchestra   moment   burden   banjo  
traps. By midnight  hilarity  increased. A celebrated tenor 
sung  Italian,   notorious contralto  sung  jazz, 
  numbers people   “stunts”    garden,
 happy, vacuous bursts  laughter rose toward  summer sky. A
pair  stage twins,  turned     girls  yellow,  
baby act  costume,  champagne  served  glasses bigger 
finger-bowls. The moon  risen higher,  floating   Sound 
 triangle  silver scales, trembling  little   stiff, tinny
drip   banjoes   lawn.

I  still  Jordan Baker. We  sitting   table   man
   age   rowdy little girl,  gave way upon 
slightest provocation  uncontrollable laughter. I  enjoying
 . I  taken two finger-bowls  champagne,   scene
 changed   eyes  something significant, elemental, 
profound.

At  lull   entertainment  man looked    smiled.

“Your face  familiar,”  said politely. “Weren’    First
Division   war?”

“Why yes. I    Twenty-eighth Infantry.”

“I    Sixteenth  June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’ seen
 somewhere .”

We talked   moment   wet, grey little villages  France.
Evidently  lived   vicinity,   told     
bought  hydroplane,   going  try     morning.

“Want  go  , old sport? Just near  shore along  Sound.”

“What time?”

“Any time  suits  best.”

It    tip   tongue  ask  name  Jordan looked
around  smiled.

“Having  gay time ?”  inquired.

“Much better.” I turned    new acquaintance. “This  
unusual party  . I ’ even seen  host. I live 
—” I waved  hand   invisible hedge   distance, “
 man Gatsby sent   chauffeur   invitation.”

For  moment  looked      failed  understand.

“I’ Gatsby,”  said suddenly.

“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg  pardon.”

“I thought  knew, old sport. I’ afraid I’    good host.”

He smiled understandingly—much   understandingly. It  one
  rare smiles   quality  eternal reassurance  , 
 may come across four  five times  life. It faced— seemed 
face— whole eternal world   instant,   concentrated 
   irresistible prejudice   favour. It understood 
  far   wanted   understood, believed    
would like  believe  ,  assured    
precisely  impression   ,   best,  hoped 
convey. Precisely   point  vanished— I  looking  
elegant young roughneck,  year  two  thirty, whose elaborate
formality  speech  missed  absurd. Some time  
introduced  I’ got  strong impression    picking 
words  care.

Almost   moment  Mr. Gatsby identified   butler
hurried toward    information  Chicago  calling 
  wire. He excused    small bow  included  
us  turn.

“If  want anything  ask  , old sport,”  urged .
“Excuse . I  rejoin  later.”

When   gone I turned immediately  Jordan—constrained  assure
   surprise. I  expected  Mr. Gatsby would   florid
 corpulent person   middle years.

“Who  ?” I demanded. “Do  know?”

“He’   man named Gatsby.”

“Where   , I mean? And    ?”

“Now ’ started   subject,”  answered   wan smile.
“Well,  told      Oxford man.”

A dim background started  take shape behind ,    next
remark  faded away.

“However, I ’ believe .”

“Why ?”

“I ’ know,”  insisted, “I  ’ think  went .”

Something   tone reminded     girl’ “I think 
killed  man,”    effect  stimulating  curiosity. I would
 accepted without question  information  Gatsby sprang 
 swamps  Louisiana    lower East Side  New York. That
 comprehensible. But young men ’— least   provincial
inexperience I believed  ’—drift coolly   nowhere 
buy  palace  Long Island Sound.

“Anyhow,  gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing  subject
  urban distaste   concrete. “And I like large parties.
They’  intimate. At small parties  ’  privacy.”

There   boom   bass drum,   voice   orchestra
leader rang  suddenly   echolalia   garden.

“Ladies  gentlemen,”  cried. “At  request  Mr. Gatsby  
going  play   Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’ latest work, 
attracted  much attention  Carnegie Hall last May. If  read 
papers  know    big sensation.” He smiled  jovial
condescension,  added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody
laughed.

“The piece  known,”  concluded lustily, “ ‘Vladmir Tostoff’
Jazz History   World!’ ”

The nature  Mr. Tostoff’ composition eluded ,    
began  eyes fell  Gatsby, standing alone   marble steps 
looking  one group  another  approving eyes. His tanned skin
 drawn attractively tight   face   short hair looked 
though   trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister 
. I wondered   fact     drinking helped  set 
   guests,   seemed     grew  correct 
 fraternal hilarity increased. When  “Jazz History   World”
 , girls  putting  heads  men’ shoulders  
puppyish, convivial way, girls  swooning backward playfully 
men’ arms, even  groups, knowing  someone would arrest 
falls—  one swooned backward  Gatsby,   French bob touched
Gatsby’ shoulder,   singing quartets  formed  Gatsby’
head  one link.

“I beg  pardon.”

Gatsby’ butler  suddenly standing beside us.

“Miss Baker?”  inquired. “I beg  pardon,  Mr. Gatsby would
like  speak   alone.”

“With ?”  exclaimed  surprise.

“Yes, madame.”

She got  slowly, raising  eyebrows    astonishment, 
followed  butler toward  house. I noticed   wore 
evening-dress,   dresses, like sports clothes—  
jauntiness   movements     first learned  walk
upon golf courses  clean, crisp mornings.

I  alone    almost two. For  time confused 
intriguing sounds  issued   long, many-windowed room 
overhung  terrace. Eluding Jordan’ undergraduate,   
engaged   obstetrical conversation  two chorus girls,  
implored   join , I went inside.

The large room  full  people. One   girls  yellow 
playing  piano,  beside  stood  tall, red-haired young lady
  famous chorus, engaged  song. She  drunk  quantity 
champagne,    course   song   decided, ineptly,
 everything  ,  sad—    singing,  
weeping . Whenever    pause   song  filled  
gasping, broken sobs,   took   lyric    quavering
soprano. The tears coursed   cheeks— freely, however, 
  came  contact   heavily beaded eyelashes 
assumed  inky colour,  pursued  rest   way  slow
black rivulets. A humorous suggestion  made   sing  notes
  face, whereupon  threw   hands, sank   chair, 
went    deep vinous sleep.

“She   fight   man  says ’  husband,” explained 
girl   elbow.

I looked around. Most   remaining women    fights
 men said    husbands. Even Jordan’ party,  quartet
 East Egg,  rent asunder  dissension. One   men 
talking  curious intensity   young actress,   wife, 
attempting  laugh   situation   dignified  indifferent
way, broke  entirely  resorted  flank attacks— intervals
 appeared suddenly   side like  angry diamond,  hissed:
“You promised!”   ear.

The reluctance  go home   confined  wayward men. The hall
  present occupied  two deplorably sober men   highly
indignant wives. The wives  sympathizing    
slightly raised voices.

“Whenever  sees I’   good time  wants  go home.”

“Never heard anything  selfish   life.”

“We’ always  first ones  leave.”

“So  .”

“Well, ’ almost  last tonight,” said one   men sheepishly.
“The orchestra left half  hour ago.”

In spite   wives’ agreement   malevolence  beyond
credibility,  dispute ended   short struggle,   wives
 lifted, kicking,   night.

As I waited   hat   hall  door   library opened 
Jordan Baker  Gatsby came  together. He  saying  last
word  ,   eagerness   manner tightened abruptly 
formality  several people approached   say goodbye.

Jordan’ party  calling impatiently     porch,  
lingered   moment  shake hands.

“I’  heard   amazing thing,”  whispered. “How long
   ?”

“Why,   hour.”

“It  … simply amazing,”  repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I
’ tell    I  tantalizing .” She yawned gracefully
  face. “Please come  see  … Phone book … Under  name 
Mrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She  hurrying   
talked— brown hand waved  jaunty salute   melted  
party   door.

Rather ashamed    first appearance I  stayed  late, I
joined  last  Gatsby’ guests,   clustered around . I
wanted  explain  I’ hunted   early   evening  
apologize    known    garden.

“Don’ mention ,”  enjoined  eagerly. “Don’ give  another
thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held   familiarity
  hand  reassuringly brushed  shoulder. “And ’
forget ’ going    hydroplane tomorrow morning,  nine
’clock.”

Then  butler, behind  shoulder:

“Philadelphia wants    phone, sir.”

“All right,   minute. Tell  I’  right  … Good night.”

“Good night.”

“Good night.” He smiled— suddenly  seemed    pleasant
significance    among  last  go,     desired
   time. “Good night, old sport … Good night.”

But  I walked   steps I saw   evening   quite
. Fifty feet   door  dozen headlights illuminated 
bizarre  tumultuous scene. In  ditch beside  road, right side
,  violently shorn  one wheel, rested  new coupé  
left Gatsby’ drive  two minutes . The sharp jut   wall
accounted   detachment   wheel,    getting
considerable attention  half  dozen curious chauffeurs. However,
   left  cars blocking  road,  harsh, discordant din
    rear   audible   time,  added 
 already violent confusion   scene.

A man   long duster  dismounted   wreck   stood 
 middle   road, looking   car   tyre   
tyre   observers   pleasant, puzzled way.

“See!”  explained. “It went   ditch.”

The fact  infinitely astonishing  ,  I recognized first 
unusual quality  wonder,    man—   late patron 
Gatsby’ library.

“How’  happen?”

He shrugged  shoulders.

“I know nothing whatever  mechanics,”  said decisively.

“But    happen? Did  run   wall?”

“Don’ ask ,” said Owl Eyes, washing  hands   whole
matter. “I know  little  driving—next  nothing. It
happened,  ’  I know.”

“Well,  ’  poor driver  oughtn’  try driving  night.”

“But I ’ even trying,”  explained indignantly, “I ’ even
trying.”

An awed hush fell upon  bystanders.

“Do  want  commit suicide?”

“You’ lucky     wheel! A bad driver   even trying!”

“You ’ understand,” explained  criminal. “I ’ driving.
There’ another man   car.”

The shock  followed  declaration found voice   sustained
“Ah-h-h!”   door   coupé swung slowly open. The crowd— 
  crowd—stepped back involuntarily,    door  opened
wide    ghostly pause. Then,  gradually, part  part, 
pale, dangling individual stepped    wreck, pawing tentatively
  ground   large uncertain dancing shoe.

Blinded   glare   headlights  confused   incessant
groaning   horns,  apparition stood swaying   moment
  perceived  man   duster.

“Wha’ matter?”  inquired calmly. “Did  run outa gas?”

“Look!”

Half  dozen fingers pointed   amputated wheel— stared  
  moment,   looked upward  though  suspected  
 dropped   sky.

“It came ,” someone explained.

He nodded.

“At first I din’ notice ’ stopped.”

A pause. Then, taking  long breath  straightening  shoulders,
 remarked   determined voice:

“Wonder’ff tell   ’  gas’line station?”

At least  dozen men,     little better    ,
explained    wheel  car   longer joined  
physical bond.

“Back ,”  suggested   moment. “Put   reverse.”

“But  wheel’ !”

He hesitated.

“No harm  trying,”  said.

The caterwauling horns  reached  crescendo  I turned away 
cut across  lawn toward home. I glanced back . A wafer  
moon  shining  Gatsby’ house, making  night fine  ,
 surviving  laughter   sound   still glowing garden.
A sudden emptiness seemed  flow    windows   great
doors, endowing  complete isolation  figure   host, 
stood   porch,  hand    formal gesture  farewell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading   I  written  far, I see I  given 
impression   events  three nights several weeks apart 
  absorbed . On  contrary,   merely casual events
  crowded summer, ,  much later,  absorbed 
infinitely less   personal affairs.

Most   time I worked. In  early morning  sun threw 
shadow westward  I hurried   white chasms  lower New York
  Probity Trust. I knew   clerks  young bond-salesmen
  first names,  lunched    dark, crowded
restaurants  little pig sausages  mashed potatoes  coffee. I
even   short affair   girl  lived  Jersey City 
worked   accounting department,   brother began throwing
mean looks   direction,    went   vacation  July I
let  blow quietly away.

I took dinner usually   Yale Club—  reason   
gloomiest event   day—  I went upstairs   library 
studied investments  securities   conscientious hour. There
 generally   rioters around,   never came  
library,     good place  work. After ,   night 
mellow, I strolled  Madison Avenue past  old Murray Hill Hotel,
  33rd Street   Pennsylvania Station.

I began  like New York,  racy, adventurous feel    night,
  satisfaction   constant flicker  men  women 
machines gives   restless eye. I liked  walk  Fifth Avenue
 pick  romantic women   crowd  imagine    
minutes I  going  enter   lives,   one would ever
know  disapprove. Sometimes,   mind, I followed   
apartments   corners  hidden streets,   turned 
smiled back     faded   door  warm
darkness. At  enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt  haunting
loneliness sometimes,  felt   others—poor young clerks 
loitered  front  windows waiting    time   solitary
restaurant dinner—young clerks   dusk, wasting   poignant
moments  night  life.

Again  eight ’clock,   dark lanes   Forties  lined
five deep  throbbing taxicabs, bound   theatre district, I
felt  sinking   heart. Forms leaned together   taxis  
waited,  voices sang,    laughter  unheard jokes,
 lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining
 I, ,  hurrying towards gaiety  sharing  intimate
excitement, I wished  well.

For   I lost sight  Jordan Baker,    midsummer I
found  . At first I  flattered  go places  ,
    golf champion,  everyone knew  name. Then 
 something . I ’ actually  love,  I felt  sort 
tender curiosity. The bored haughty face   turned   world
concealed something— affectations conceal something eventually,
even though  ’   beginning— one day I found  
. When     house-party together   Warwick,  left 
borrowed car    rain   top ,   lied 
— suddenly I remembered  story     eluded 
 night  Daisy’. At  first big golf tournament   
row  nearly reached  newspapers— suggestion    moved
 ball   bad lie   semifinal round. The thing approached
 proportions   scandal— died away. A caddy retracted 
statement,     witness admitted   might  
mistaken. The incident   name  remained together   mind.

Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men,   I saw
     felt safer   plane   divergence
  code would  thought impossible. She  incurably dishonest.
She ’ able  endure    disadvantage , given 
unwillingness, I suppose   begun dealing  subterfuges  
  young  order  keep  cool, insolent smile turned 
 world  yet satisfy  demands   hard, jaunty body.

It made  difference  . Dishonesty   woman   thing 
never blame deeply—I  casually sorry,   I forgot. It  
  house-party     curious conversation  driving
 car. It started   passed  close   workmen  
fender flicked  button  one man’ coat.

“You’  rotten driver,” I protested. “Either  ought   
careful,   oughtn’  drive  .”

“I  careful.”

“No, ’ .”

“Well,  people ,”  said lightly.

“What’  got    ?”

“They’ keep    way,”  insisted. “It takes two  make 
accident.”

“Suppose  met somebody   careless  .”

“I hope I never ,”  answered. “I hate careless people. That’
 I like .”

Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead,   
deliberately shifted  relations,    moment I thought I loved
. But I  slow-thinking  full  interior rules  act 
brakes   desires,  I knew  first I   get 
definitely    tangle back home. I’  writing letters 
 week  signing : “Love, Nick,”   I could think  
,   certain girl played tennis,  faint moustache 
perspiration appeared   upper lip. Nevertheless    vague
understanding     tactfully broken   I  free.

Everyone suspects    least one   cardinal virtues, 
  mine: I  one    honest people  I  ever
known.


                                  IV

On Sunday morning  church bells rang   villages alongshore,
 world   mistress returned  Gatsby’ house  twinkled
hilariously   lawn.

“He’  bootlegger,” said  young ladies, moving somewhere 
 cocktails   flowers. “One time  killed  man   found
    nephew  Von Hindenburg  second cousin  
devil. Reach   rose, honey,  pour   last drop   
crystal glass.”

Once I wrote    empty spaces   timetable  names 
  came  Gatsby’ house  summer. It   old timetable
, disintegrating   folds,  headed “This schedule  effect
July 5th, 1922.” But I  still read  grey names,   
give   better impression   generalities

All  people came  Gatsby’ house   summer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At nine ’clock, one morning late  July, Gatsby’ gorgeous car
lurched   rocky drive   door  gave   burst  melody
  three-noted horn.

It   first time   called  , though I  gone  two 
 parties, mounted   hydroplane, ,   urgent invitation,
made frequent use   beach.

“Good morning, old sport. You’  lunch   today  I
thought ’ ride  together.”

He  balancing    dashboard   car  
resourcefulness  movement    peculiarly American— comes,
I suppose,   absence  lifting work  youth , even ,
  formless grace   nervous, sporadic games. This quality
 continually breaking   punctilious manner   shape
 restlessness. He  never quite still;   always  tapping
foot somewhere   impatient opening  closing   hand.

He saw  looking  admiration   car.

“It’ pretty, ’ , old sport?” He jumped   give   better
view. “Haven’  ever seen  ?”

I’ seen . Everybody  seen . It   rich cream colour, bright
 nickel, swollen      monstrous length 
triumphant hatboxes  supper-boxes  toolboxes,  terraced 
 labyrinth  windshields  mirrored  dozen suns. Sitting 
behind many layers  glass   sort  green leather conservatory,
 started  town.

I  talked   perhaps half  dozen times   past month 
found,   disappointment,    little  say. So  first
impression,     person   undefined consequence, 
gradually faded    become simply  proprietor  
elaborate roadhouse next door.

And  came  disconcerting ride. We ’ reached West Egg
village  Gatsby began leaving  elegant sentences unfinished
 slapping  indecisively   knee   caramel-coloured
suit.

“Look , old sport,”  broke  surprisingly, “’ 
opinion  , anyhow?”

A little overwhelmed, I began  generalized evasions  
question deserves.

“Well, I’ going  tell  something   life,”  interrupted.
“I ’ want   get  wrong idea      stories 
hear.”

So   aware   bizarre accusations  flavoured conversation
  halls.

“I’ tell  God’ truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine
retribution  stand . “I   son   wealthy people  
Middle West— dead . I  brought   America  educated 
Oxford,    ancestors   educated   many
years. It   family tradition.”

He looked   sideways— I knew  Jordan Baker  believed 
 lying. He hurried  phrase “educated  Oxford,”  swallowed
,  choked  ,  though   bothered  . And 
 doubt,  whole statement fell  pieces,  I wondered 
 ’ something  little sinister  ,  .

“What part   Middle West?” I inquired casually.

“San Francisco.”

“I see.”

“My family  died  I came   good deal  money.”

His voice  solemn,    memory   sudden extinction  
clan still haunted . For  moment I suspected    pulling
 leg,   glance   convinced  otherwise.

“After  I lived like  young rajah    capitals 
Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting
big game, painting  little, things   ,  trying 
forget something  sad   happened   long ago.”

With  effort I managed  restrain  incredulous laughter. The 
phrases  worn  threadbare   evoked  image except 
  turbaned “character” leaking sawdust  every pore   pursued
 tiger   Bois de Boulogne.

“Then came  war, old sport. It   great relief,  I tried 
hard  die,  I seemed  bear  enchanted life. I accepted 
commission  first lieutenant   began. In  Argonne Forest I
took  remains   machine-gun battalion  far forward  
  half mile gap  either side  us   infantry ’
advance. We stayed  two days  two nights,  hundred  thirty
men  sixteen Lewis guns,    infantry came   last
 found  insignia  three German divisions among  piles 
dead. I  promoted    major,  every Allied government gave
  decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro   
Adriatic Sea!”

Little Montenegro! He lifted   words  nodded  — 
smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’ troubled history 
sympathized   brave struggles   Montenegrin people. It
appreciated fully  chain  national circumstances  
elicited  tribute  Montenegro’ warm little heart. My
incredulity  submerged  fascination ;   like skimming
hastily   dozen magazines.

He reached   pocket,   piece  metal, slung   ribbon,
fell   palm.

“That’  one  Montenegro.”

To  astonishment,  thing   authentic look. “Orderi di
Danilo,” ran  circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”

“Turn .”

“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”

“Here’ another thing I always carry. A souvenir  Oxford days. It
 taken  Trinity Quad— man   left    Earl 
Doncaster.”

It   photograph  half  dozen young men  blazers loafing  
archway    visible  host  spires. There  Gatsby,
looking  little,  much, younger—  cricket bat   hand.

Then    true. I saw  skins  tigers flaming   palace
  Grand Canal; I saw  opening  chest  rubies  ease, 
 crimson-lighted depths,  gnawings   broken heart.

“I’ going  make  big request   today,”  said, pocketing 
souvenirs  satisfaction, “ I thought  ought  know something
 . I ’ want   think I    nobody. You see,
I usually find  among strangers  I drift   
trying  forget  sad things  happened  .” He hesitated.
“You’ hear    afternoon.”

“At lunch?”

“No,  afternoon. I happened  find   ’ taking Miss
Baker  tea.”

“Do  mean ’  love  Miss Baker?”

“No, old sport, I’ . But Miss Baker  kindly consented  speak
    matter.”

I ’  faintest idea  “ matter” ,  I  
annoyed  interested. I ’ asked Jordan  tea  order 
discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I  sure  request would  something
utterly fantastic,    moment I  sorry I’ ever set foot upon
 overpopulated lawn.

He ’ say another word. His correctness grew     neared
 city. We passed Port Roosevelt,     glimpse 
red-belted oceangoing ships,  sped along  cobbled slum lined 
 dark, undeserted saloons   faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.
Then  valley  ashes opened    sides  us,  I  
glimpse  Mrs. Wilson straining   garage pump  panting
vitality   went .

With fenders spread like wings  scattered light  half
Astoria— half,    twisted among  pillars   elevated
I heard  familiar “jug-jug-spat!”   motorcycle,   frantic
policeman rode alongside.

“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed . Taking  white
card   wallet,  waved    man’ eyes.

“Right  ,” agreed  policeman, tipping  cap. “Know  next
time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse !”

“What  ?” I inquired. “The picture  Oxford?”

“I  able    commissioner  favour ,   sends  
Christmas card every year.”

Over  great bridge,   sunlight   girders making 
constant flicker upon  moving cars,   city rising  across
 river  white heaps  sugar lumps  built   wish  
nonolfactory money. The city seen   Queensboro Bridge  always
 city seen   first time,   first wild promise   
mystery   beauty   world.

A dead man passed us   hearse heaped  blooms, followed  two
carriages  drawn blinds,    cheerful carriages 
friends. The friends looked   us   tragic eyes  short
upper lips  southeastern Europe,  I  glad   sight 
Gatsby’ splendid car  included   sombre holiday. As 
crossed Blackwell’ Island  limousine passed us, driven   white
chauffeur,   sat three modish negroes, two bucks   girl. I
laughed aloud   yolks   eyeballs rolled toward us 
haughty rivalry.

“Anything  happen   ’ slid   bridge,” I thought;
“anything   …”

Even Gatsby could happen, without  particular wonder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roaring noon. In  well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby
 lunch. Blinking away  brightness   street outside,  eyes
picked   obscurely   anteroom, talking  another man.

“Mr. Carraway,    friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”

A small, flat-nosed Jew raised  large head  regarded   two
fine growths  hair  luxuriated  either nostril. After 
moment I discovered  tiny eyes   half-darkness.

“—So I took one look  ,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking  hand
earnestly, “    think I ?”

“What?” I inquired politely.

But evidently    addressing ,   dropped  hand 
covered Gatsby   expressive nose.

“I handed  money  Katspaugh  I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,
’ pay   penny till  shuts  mouth.’ He shut   
.”

Gatsby took  arm    us  moved forward  
restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed  new sentence  
starting  lapsed   somnambulatory abstraction.

“Highballs?” asked  head waiter.

“This   nice restaurant ,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking  
presbyterian nymphs   ceiling. “But I like across  street
better!”

“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby,    Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’ 
hot  .”

“Hot  small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “ full  memories.”

“What place  ?” I asked.

“The old Metropole.”

“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled 
faces dead  gone. Filled  friends gone  forever. I ’
forget  long  I live  night  shot Rosy Rosenthal . It
 six  us   table,  Rosy  eat  drunk  lot 
evening. When   almost morning  waiter came     
funny look  says somebody wants  speak   outside. ‘All
right,’ says Rosy,  begins  get ,  I pulled    
chair.

“ ‘Let  bastards come     want , Rosy,  ’
,  help , move outside  room.’

“It  four ’clock   morning ,   ’  raised 
blinds ’  seen daylight.”

“Did  go?” I asked innocently.

“Sure  went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’ nose flashed   indignantly. “He
turned around   door  says: ‘Don’ let  waiter take away
 coffee!’ Then  went    sidewalk,   shot  three
times   full belly  drove away.”

“Four    electrocuted,” I said, remembering.

“Five,  Becker.” His nostrils turned     interested way.
“I understand ’ looking   business gonnegtion.”

The juxtaposition   two remarks  startling. Gatsby answered
 :

“Oh, ,”  exclaimed, “ ’  man.”

“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.

“This    friend. I told  ’ talk    
time.”

“I beg  pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I   wrong man.”

A succulent hash arrived,  Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting  
sentimental atmosphere   old Metropole, began  eat 
ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved  slowly  around
 room— completed  arc  turning  inspect  people
directly behind. I think , except   presence,  would 
taken one short glance beneath   table.

“Look , old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward , “I’ afraid I
made   little angry  morning   car.”

There   smile ,   time I held   .

“I ’ like mysteries,” I answered, “ I ’ understand  
’ come  frankly  tell    want. Why    got
 come  Miss Baker?”

“Oh, ’ nothing underhand,”  assured . “Miss Baker’  great
sportswoman,  know,  ’ never  anything  ’ 
right.”

Suddenly  looked   watch, jumped ,  hurried   room,
leaving   Mr. Wolfshiem   table.

“He   telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following   
eyes. “Fine fellow, ’ ? Handsome  look    perfect
gentleman.”

“Yes.”

“He’  Oggsford man.”

“Oh!”

“He went  Oggsford College  England. You know Oggsford College?”

“I’ heard  .”

“It’ one    famous colleges   world.”

“Have  known Gatsby   long time?” I inquired.

“Several years,”  answered   gratified way. “I made  pleasure
  acquaintance    war. But I knew I  discovered 
man  fine breeding  I talked    hour. I said 
: ‘There’  kind  man ’ like  take home  introduce
  mother  sister.’ ” He paused. “I see ’ looking  
cuff buttons.”

I ’  looking  ,  I  . They  composed 
oddly familiar pieces  ivory.

“Finest specimens  human molars,”  informed .

“Well!” I inspected . “That’   interesting idea.”

“Yeah.” He flipped  sleeves    coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’ 
careful  women. He would never  much  look   friend’
wife.”

When  subject   instinctive trust returned   table 
sat  Mr. Wolfshiem drank  coffee   jerk  got  
feet.

“I  enjoyed  lunch,”  said, “ I’ going  run   
two young men  I outstay  welcome.”

“Don’ hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem
raised  hand   sort  benediction.

“You’  polite,  I belong  another generation,”  announced
solemnly. “You sit   discuss  sports   young ladies
 —” He supplied  imaginary noun  another wave  
hand. “As  , I  fifty years old,  I ’ impose  
  longer.”

As  shook hands  turned away  tragic nose  trembling. I
wondered  I  said anything  offend .

“He becomes  sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This 
one   sentimental days. He’ quite  character around New York—
denizen  Broadway.”

“Who  , anyhow,  actor?”

“No.”

“A dentist?”

“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, ’  gambler.” Gatsby hesitated,  added,
coolly: “He’  man  fixed  World’ Series back  1919.”

“Fixed  World’ Series?” I repeated.

The idea staggered . I remembered,  course,   World’
Series   fixed  1919,   I  thought     I
would  thought     thing  merely happened,  end 
 inevitable chain. It never occurred    one man could
start  play   faith  fifty million people— 
single-mindedness   burglar blowing  safe.

“How   happen   ?” I asked   minute.

“He  saw  opportunity.”

“Why ’   jail?”

“They ’ get , old sport. He’  smart man.”

I insisted  paying  check. As  waiter brought  change I
caught sight  Tom Buchanan across  crowded room.

“Come along     minute,” I said; “I’ got  say hello 
someone.”

When  saw us Tom jumped   took half  dozen steps  
direction.

“Where’  ?”  demanded eagerly. “Daisy’ furious  
’ called .”

“This  Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”

They shook hands briefly,   strained, unfamiliar look 
embarrassment came  Gatsby’ face.

“How’  , anyhow?” demanded Tom  . “How’  happen 
come   far  eat?”

“I’   lunch  Mr. Gatsby.”

I turned toward Mr. Gatsby,     longer .

One October day  nineteen-seventeen—

(said Jordan Baker  afternoon, sitting   straight  
straight chair   tea-garden   Plaza Hotel)

—I  walking along  one place  another, half   sidewalks

  disapproving way.

The largest   banners   largest   lawns belonged

When I came opposite  house  morning  white roadster 
beside  kerb,    sitting     lieutenant I 
never seen . They   engrossed

“Hello, Jordan,”  called unexpectedly. “Please come .”

I  flattered   wanted  speak  ,    
older girls I admired  . She asked   I  going   Red
Cross  make bandages. I . Well, , would I tell   
’ come  day? The officer looked  Daisy   
speaking,   way  every young girl wants   looked 
sometime,    seemed romantic   I  remembered 
incident ever since. His name  Jay Gatsby,  I ’ lay eyes 
    four years—even  I’ met   Long Island I
’ realize     man.

That  nineteen-seventeen. By  next year I    beaux
,  I began  play  tournaments,  I ’ see Daisy 
often. She went   slightly older crowd—  went  anyone
 . Wild rumours  circulating  —  mother 
found  packing  bag one winter night  go  New York  say

prevented,   ’  speaking terms   family

By  next autumn   gay , gay  ever. She   début

gave   string  pearls valued  three hundred  fifty thousand
dollars.

I   bridesmaid. I came   room half  hour

 Sauterne  one hand   letter   .

“ ’Gratulate ,”  muttered. “Never   drink ,  oh 
I  enjoy .”

“What’  matter, Daisy?”

I  scared, I  tell ; I’ never seen  girl like  .

“Here, dearies.” She groped around   wastebasket    
  bed  pulled   string  pearls. “Take ’em downstairs
 give ’em back  whoever  belong . Tell ’em  Daisy’
change’  mine. Say: ‘Daisy’ change’  mine!’ ”

She began  cry— cried  cried. I rushed   found 
mother’ maid,   locked  door  got    cold bath.
She ’ let go   letter. She took    tub  
 squeezed     wet ball,   let  leave

But  ’ say another word. We gave  spirits  ammonia

 hour later,   walked    room,  pearls  around
 neck   incident  . Next day  five ’clock 
married Tom Buchanan without  much   shiver,  started   
three months’ trip   South Seas.

I saw   Santa Barbara   came back,  I thought I’
never seen  girl  mad   husband. If  left  room  
minute ’ look around uneasily,  say: “Where’ Tom gone?” 
wear   abstracted expression   saw  coming

unfathomable delight. It  touching  see  together— made 
laugh   hushed, fascinated way. That   August. A week  I
left Santa Barbara Tom ran   wagon   Ventura road one night,
 ripped  front wheel   car. The girl     got
  papers, ,   arm  broken—  one  
chambermaids   Santa Barbara Hotel.

The next April Daisy   little girl,   went  France 
 year. I saw  one spring  Cannes,  later  Deauville, 
  came back  Chicago  settle . Daisy  popular 
Chicago,   know. They moved   fast crowd,    young
 rich  wild,   came    absolutely perfect
reputation. Perhaps   ’ drink. It’  great advantage
  drink among hard-drinking people. You  hold  tongue ,
moreover,   time  little irregularity     
everybody else   blind   ’ see  care. Perhaps Daisy
never went   amour  — yet ’ something   voice
  …

Well,  six weeks ago,  heard  name Gatsby   first
time  years. It   I asked —  remember?—  knew
Gatsby  West Egg. After   gone home  came   room 
woke  ,  said: “What Gatsby?”   I described —I 
half asleep— said   strangest voice   must   man
 used  know. It ’    I connected  Gatsby
  officer   white car.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Jordan Baker  finished telling     left  Plaza
 half  hour   driving   victoria  Central Park.
The sun  gone  behind  tall apartments   movie stars 
 West Fifties,   clear voices  children, already gathered
like crickets   grass, rose   hot twilight:

 “I’  Sheik  Araby. Your love belongs  . At night 
 ’ asleep Into  tent I’ creep—”

“It   strange coincidence,” I said.

“But  ’  coincidence  .”

“Why ?”

“Gatsby bought  house   Daisy would   across  bay.”

Then     merely  stars     aspired  
June night. He came alive  , delivered suddenly   womb 
 purposeless splendour.

“He wants  know,” continued Jordan, “ ’ invite Daisy  
house  afternoon   let  come .”

The modesty   demand shook . He  waited five years 
bought  mansion   dispensed starlight  casual moths— 
 could “come ”  afternoon   stranger’ garden.

“Did I   know     could ask   little thing?”

“He’ afraid, ’ waited  long. He thought  might 
offended. You see, ’ regular tough underneath  .”

Something worried .

“Why ’  ask   arrange  meeting?”

“He wants   see  house,”  explained. “And  house 
right next door.”

“Oh!”

“I think  half expected   wander  one   parties, 
night,” went  Jordan, “  never . Then  began asking
people casually   knew ,  I   first one  found. It
  night  sent     dance,     heard
 elaborate way  worked   . Of course, I immediately
suggested  luncheon  New York— I thought ’ go mad:

“ ‘I ’ want   anything    way!’  kept saying. ‘I
want  see  right next door.’

“When I said    particular friend  Tom’,  started 
abandon  whole idea. He ’ know  much  Tom, though 
says ’ read  Chicago paper  years    chance 
catching  glimpse  Daisy’ name.”

It  dark ,    dipped   little bridge I put  arm
around Jordan’ golden shoulder  drew  toward   asked 
 dinner. Suddenly I ’ thinking  Daisy  Gatsby  ,
   clean, hard, limited person,  dealt  universal
scepticism,   leaned back jauntily  within  circle  
arm. A phrase began  beat   ears   sort  heady
excitement: “There    pursued,  pursuing,  busy, 
 tired.”

“And Daisy ought   something   life,” murmured Jordan 
.

“Does  want  see Gatsby?”

“She’   know  . Gatsby ’ want   know. You’
 supposed  invite   tea.”

We passed  barrier  dark trees,    façade  Fifty-Ninth
Street,  block  delicate pale light, beamed    park.
Unlike Gatsby  Tom Buchanan, I   girl whose disembodied face
floated along  dark cornices  blinding signs,   I drew 
 girl beside , tightening  arms. Her wan, scornful mouth
smiled,   I drew    closer,  time   face.


                                  V

When I came home  West Egg  night I  afraid   moment 
 house   fire. Two ’clock   whole corner  
peninsula  blazing  light,  fell unreal   shrubbery
 made thin elongating glints upon  roadside wires. Turning 
corner, I saw    Gatsby’ house, lit  tower  cellar.

At first I thought   another party,  wild rout   resolved
  “hide--go-seek”  “sardines---box”   
house thrown open   game. But  ’  sound. Only wind 
 trees,  blew  wires  made  lights go   
    house  winked   darkness. As  taxi groaned
away I saw Gatsby walking toward  across  lawn.

“Your place looks like  World’ Fair,” I said.

“Does ?” He turned  eyes toward  absently. “I  
glancing     rooms. Let’ go  Coney Island, old
sport. In  car.”

“It’  late.”

“Well, suppose  take  plunge   swimming pool? I ’ made
use    summer.”

“I’ got  go  bed.”

“All right.”

He waited, looking    suppressed eagerness.

“I talked  Miss Baker,” I said   moment. “I’ going  call
 Daisy tomorrow  invite     tea.”

“Oh, ’  right,”  said carelessly. “I ’ want  put 
  trouble.”

“What day would suit ?”

“What day would suit ?”  corrected  quickly. “I ’ want 
put    trouble,  see.”

“How   day  tomorrow?”

He considered   moment. Then,  reluctance: “I want  get 
grass cut,”  said.

We  looked    grass—   sharp line  
ragged lawn ended   darker, well-kept expanse   began. I
suspected   meant  grass.

“There’ another little thing,”  said uncertainly,  hesitated.

“Would  rather put      days?” I asked.

“Oh,  ’  . At least—” He fumbled   series 
beginnings. “Why, I thought—, look , old sport,  ’ make
much money,  ?”

“Not  much.”

This seemed  reassure    continued  confidently.

“I thought  ’,  ’ pardon — see, I carry  
little business   side,  sort  side line,  understand. And
I thought    ’ make  much—You’ selling bonds,
’ , old sport?”

“Trying .”

“Well,  would interest . It ’ take  much   time
  might pick   nice bit  money. It happens    rather
confidential sort  thing.”

I realize    different circumstances  conversation
might   one   crises   life. But,   offer
 obviously  tactlessly   service   rendered, I  
choice except  cut   .

“I’ got  hands full,” I said. “I’ much obliged  I ’
take    work.”

“You ’     business  Wolfshiem.” Evidently 
thought  I  shying away   “gonnegtion” mentioned 
lunch,  I assured    wrong. He waited  moment longer,
hoping I’ begin  conversation,  I   absorbed  
responsive,   went unwillingly home.

The evening  made  lightheaded  happy; I think I walked  
deep sleep  I entered  front door. So I ’ know whether  
Gatsby went  Coney Island,    many hours  “glanced 
rooms”   house blazed gaudily . I called  Daisy  
office next morning,  invited   come  tea.

“Don’ bring Tom,” I warned .

“What?”

“Don’ bring Tom.”

“Who  ‘Tom’?”  asked innocently.

The day agreed upon  pouring rain. At eleven ’clock  man  
raincoat, dragging  lawn-mower, tapped   front door  said 
Mr. Gatsby  sent    cut  grass. This reminded   I
 forgotten  tell  Finn  come back,  I drove  West Egg
Village  search   among soggy whitewashed alleys   buy
 cups  lemons  flowers.

The flowers  unnecessary,   two ’clock  greenhouse arrived
 Gatsby’,  innumerable receptacles  contain . An hour
later  front door opened nervously,  Gatsby   white flannel
suit, silver shirt,  gold-coloured tie, hurried . He  pale,
   dark signs  sleeplessness beneath  eyes.

“Is everything  right?”  asked immediately.

“The grass looks fine,  ’   mean.”

“What grass?”  inquired blankly. “Oh,  grass   yard.” He
looked   window  , , judging   expression, I ’
believe  saw  thing.

“Looks  good,”  remarked vaguely. “One   papers said 
thought  rain would stop  four. I think   The
Journal. Have  got everything  need   shape — tea?”

I took    pantry,   looked  little reproachfully 
 Finn. Together  scrutinized  twelve lemon cakes  
delicatessen shop.

“Will  ?” I asked.

“Of course,  course! They’ fine!”   added hollowly, “… old
sport.”

The rain cooled  half-past three   damp mist,  
occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked  vacant eyes
  copy  Clay’ Economics, starting   Finnish tread 
shook  kitchen floor,  peering towards  bleared windows 
time  time    series  invisible  alarming happenings 
taking place outside. Finally  got   informed ,  
uncertain voice,    going home.

“Why’ ?”

“Nobody’ coming  tea. It’  late!” He looked   watch  
   pressing demand   time elsewhere. “I ’ wait
 day.”

“Don’  silly; ’  two minutes  four.”

He sat  miserably,   I  pushed ,  simultaneously
   sound   motor turning   lane. We  jumped
, ,  little harrowed , I went    yard.

Under  dripping bare lilac-trees  large open car  coming  
drive. It stopped. Daisy’ face, tipped sideways beneath 
three-cornered lavender hat, looked      bright ecstatic
smile.

“Is  absolutely   live,  dearest one?”

The exhilarating ripple   voice   wild tonic   rain. I
  follow  sound     moment,   ,   ear
alone,   words came . A damp streak  hair lay like 
dash  blue paint across  cheek,   hand  wet 
glistening drops  I took   help    car.

“Are   love  ,”  said low   ear, “   I 
 come alone?”

“That’  secret  Castle Rackrent. Tell  chauffeur  go far
away  spend  hour.”

“Come back   hour, Ferdie.” Then   grave murmur: “His name 
Ferdie.”

“Does  gasoline affect  nose?”

“I ’ think ,”  said innocently. “Why?”

We went . To  overwhelming surprise  living-room  deserted.

“Well, ’ funny,” I exclaimed.

“What’ funny?”

She turned  head     light dignified knocking  
front door. I went   opened . Gatsby, pale  death,  
hands plunged like weights   coat pockets,  standing  
puddle  water glaring tragically   eyes.

With  hands still   coat pockets  stalked    
hall, turned sharply       wire,  disappeared  
living-room. It ’  bit funny. Aware   loud beating  
 heart I pulled  door    increasing rain.

For half  minute  ’  sound. Then   living-room I
heard  sort  choking murmur  part   laugh, followed 
Daisy’ voice   clear artificial note:

“I certainly  awfully glad  see  .”

A pause;  endured horribly. I  nothing     hall,  I
went   room.

Gatsby,  hands still   pockets,  reclining  
mantelpiece   strained counterfeit  perfect ease, even 
boredom. His head leaned back  far   rested   face
  defunct mantelpiece clock,    position  distraught
eyes stared   Daisy,   sitting, frightened  graceful,
  edge   stiff chair.

“We’ met ,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily 
,   lips parted   abortive attempt   laugh. Luckily
 clock took  moment  tilt dangerously   pressure  
head, whereupon  turned  caught   trembling fingers, 
set  back  place. Then  sat , rigidly,  elbow   arm
  sofa   chin   hand.

“I’ sorry   clock,”  said.

My  face   assumed  deep tropical burn. I ’ muster 
 single commonplace    thousand   head.

“It’  old clock,” I told  idiotically.

I think   believed   moment    smashed  pieces 
 floor.

“We ’ met  many years,” said Daisy,  voice 
matter--fact   could ever .

“Five years next November.”

The automatic quality  Gatsby’ answer set us  back  least
another minute. I      feet   desperate
suggestion   help  make tea   kitchen   demoniac
Finn brought     tray.

Amid  welcome confusion  cups  cakes  certain physical
decency established . Gatsby got    shadow ,
 Daisy  I talked, looked conscientiously  one   
 us  tense, unhappy eyes. However,  calmness ’  end 
, I made  excuse   first possible moment,  got  
feet.

“Where   going?” demanded Gatsby  immediate alarm.

“I’  back.”

“I’ got  speak    something   go.”

He followed  wildly   kitchen, closed  door, 
whispered: “Oh, God!”   miserable way.

“What’  matter?”

“This   terrible mistake,”  said, shaking  head  side 
side, “ terrible, terrible mistake.”

“You’  embarrassed, ’ ,”  luckily I added: “Daisy’
embarrassed .”

“She’ embarrassed?”  repeated incredulously.

“Just  much   .”

“Don’ talk  loud.”

“You’ acting like  little boy,” I broke  impatiently. “Not 
,  ’ rude. Daisy’ sitting    alone.”

He raised  hand  stop  words, looked    unforgettable
reproach, , opening  door cautiously, went back   
room.

I walked   back way—  Gatsby     made 
nervous circuit   house half  hour — ran   huge
black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made  fabric  
rain. Once    pouring,   irregular lawn, well-shaved 
Gatsby’ gardener, abounded  small muddy swamps  prehistoric
marshes. There  nothing  look     tree except
Gatsby’ enormous house,  I stared  , like Kant   church
steeple,  half  hour. A brewer  built  early   “period”
craze,  decade ,     story  ’ agreed  pay
five years’ taxes    neighbouring cottages   owners would
  roofs thatched  straw. Perhaps  refusal took 
heart    plan  Found  Family— went   immediate
decline. His children sold  house   black wreath still 
 door. Americans,  willing, even eager,   serfs, 
always  obstinate   peasantry.

After half  hour,  sun shone ,   grocer’ automobile
rounded Gatsby’ drive   raw material   servants’
dinner—I felt sure  ’ eat  spoonful. A maid began opening
 upper windows   house, appeared momentarily  , ,
leaning   large central bay, spat meditatively  
garden. It  time I went back. While  rain continued  
seemed like  murmur   voices, rising  swelling  little
    gusts  emotion. But   new silence I felt 
silence  fallen within  house .

I went — making every possible noise   kitchen, short 
pushing   stove— I ’ believe  heard  sound. They
 sitting  either end   couch, looking     
 question   asked,     air,  every vestige 
embarrassment  gone. Daisy’ face  smeared  tears,  
I came   jumped   began wiping     handkerchief
  mirror. But    change  Gatsby   simply
confounding. He literally glowed; without  word   gesture 
exultation  new well- radiated    filled  little
room.

“Oh, hello, old sport,”  said,    ’ seen   years. I
thought   moment   going  shake hands.

“It’ stopped raining.”

“Has ?” When  realized  I  talking ,   
twinkle-bells  sunshine   room,  smiled like  weather man,
like  ecstatic patron  recurrent light,  repeated  news 
Daisy. “What   think  ? It’ stopped raining.”

“I’ glad, Jay.” Her throat, full  aching, grieving beauty, told
   unexpected joy.

“I want   Daisy  come    house,”  said, “I’ like 
show  around.”

“You’ sure  want   come?”

“Absolutely, old sport.”

Daisy went upstairs  wash  face— late I thought 
humiliation   towels— Gatsby  I waited   lawn.

“My house looks well, ’ ?”  demanded. “See   whole
front   catches  light.”

I agreed    splendid.

“Yes.” His eyes went  , every arched door  square tower. “It
took   three years  earn  money  bought .”

“I thought  inherited  money.”

“I , old sport,”  said automatically, “ I lost    
 big panic— panic   war.”

I think  hardly knew    saying,   I asked  
business     answered: “That’  affair,”   realized
  ’  appropriate reply.

“Oh, I’   several things,”  corrected . “I   
drug business   I    oil business. But I’  
either one .” He looked     attention. “Do  mean
’  thinking   I proposed   night?”

Before I could answer, Daisy came    house  two rows 
brass buttons   dress gleamed   sunlight.

“That huge place ?”  cried pointing.

“Do  like ?”

“I love ,  I ’ see   live   alone.”

“I keep  always full  interesting people, night  day. People
  interesting things. Celebrated people.”

Instead  taking  shortcut along  Sound  went   
road  entered   big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy
admired  aspect     feudal silhouette   sky,
admired  gardens,  sparkling odour  jonquils   frothy
odour  hawthorn  plum blossoms   pale gold odour 
kiss----gate. It  strange  reach  marble steps  find
 stir  bright dresses     door,  hear  sound 
bird voices   trees.

And inside,   wandered  Marie Antoinette music-rooms 
Restoration Salons, I felt    guests concealed behind
every couch  table,  orders   breathlessly silent  
 passed . As Gatsby closed  door  “ Merton College
Library” I could  sworn I heard  owl-eyed man break 
ghostly laughter.

We went upstairs,  period bedrooms swathed  rose  lavender
silk  vivid  new flowers,  dressing-rooms  poolrooms,
 bathrooms  sunken baths—intruding  one chamber  
dishevelled man  pyjamas   liver exercises   floor. It
 Mr. Klipspringer,  “boarder.” I  seen  wandering hungrily
  beach  morning. Finally  came  Gatsby’ 
apartment,  bedroom   bath,   Adam’ study,   sat
  drank  glass   Chartreuse  took   cupboard 
 wall.

He ’  ceased looking  Daisy,  I think  revalued
everything   house according   measure  response  drew
  well-loved eyes. Sometimes ,  stared around  
possessions   dazed way,  though   actual  astounding
presence none     longer real. Once  nearly toppled  
flight  stairs.

His bedroom   simplest room  —except   dresser 
garnished   toilet set  pure dull gold. Daisy took  brush
 delight,  smoothed  hair, whereupon Gatsby sat  
shaded  eyes  began  laugh.

“It’  funniest thing, old sport,”  said hilariously. “I
’—When I try —”

He  passed visibly  two states   entering upon 
third. After  embarrassment   unreasoning joy   consumed
 wonder   presence. He   full   idea  long,
dreamed  right    end, waited   teeth set,  
speak,   inconceivable pitch  intensity. Now,   reaction,
  running  like  -wound clock.

Recovering    minute  opened  us two hulking patent
cabinets  held  massed suits  dressing-gowns  ties, 
 shirts, piled like bricks  stacks  dozen high.

“I’ got  man  England  buys  clothes. He sends  
selection  things   beginning   season, spring  fall.”

He took   pile  shirts  began throwing , one  one,
 us, shirts  sheer linen  thick silk  fine flannel,
 lost  folds   fell  covered  table 
many-coloured disarray. While  admired  brought    soft
rich heap mounted higher—shirts  stripes  scrolls  plaids 
coral  apple-green  lavender  faint orange,  monograms 
indian blue. Suddenly,   strained sound, Daisy bent  head 
 shirts  began  cry stormily.

“They’  beautiful shirts,”  sobbed,  voice muffled  
thick folds. “It makes  sad  I’ never seen —
beautiful shirts .”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After  house,    see  grounds   swimming pool, 
 hydroplane,   midsummer flowers— outside Gatsby’ window
 began  rain ,   stood   row looking   corrugated
surface   Sound.

“If  ’   mist  could see  home across  bay,”
said Gatsby. “You always   green light  burns  night 
 end   dock.”

Daisy put  arm   abruptly,   seemed absorbed  
   said. Possibly   occurred     colossal
significance   light   vanished forever. Compared  
great distance   separated   Daisy   seemed 
near  , almost touching . It  seemed  close   star 
 moon. Now     green light   dock. His count 
enchanted objects  diminished  one.

I began  walk   room, examining various indefinite objects
  half darkness. A large photograph   elderly man  yachting
costume attracted , hung   wall   desk.

“Who’ ?”

“That? That’ Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”

The name sounded faintly familiar.

“He’ dead . He used    best friend years ago.”

There   small picture  Gatsby, also  yachting costume,  
bureau—Gatsby   head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently
    eighteen.

“I adore ,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told  
  pompadour—  yacht.”

“Look  ,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’  lot  clippings—
.”

They stood side  side examining . I  going  ask  see 
rubies   phone rang,  Gatsby took   receiver.

“Yes … Well, I ’ talk  … I ’ talk , old sport … I said 
small town … He must know   small town  … Well, ’  use 
us  Detroit   idea   small town …”

He rang .

“Come  quick!” cried Daisy   window.

The rain  still falling,   darkness  parted   west,
    pink  golden billow  foamy clouds   sea.

“Look  ,”  whispered,     moment: “I’ like 
 get one   pink clouds  put     push 
around.”

I tried  go ,   ’ hear  ; perhaps  presence
made  feel  satisfactorily alone.

“I know  ’ ,” said Gatsby, “’  Klipspringer play 
piano.”

He went    room calling “Ewing!”  returned    minutes
accompanied   embarrassed, slightly worn young man, 
shell-rimmed glasses  scanty blond hair. He   decently
clothed   “sport shirt,” open   neck, sneakers,  duck
trousers   nebulous hue.

“Did  interrupt  exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.

“I  asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer,   spasm  embarrassment.
“That , I’  asleep. Then I got  …”

“Klipspringer plays  piano,” said Gatsby, cutting  . “Don’
, Ewing, old sport?”

“I ’ play well. I ’—hardly play  . I’    prac—”

“We’ go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped  switch. The
grey windows disappeared   house glowed full  light.

In  music-room Gatsby turned   solitary lamp beside  piano.
He lit Daisy’ cigarette   trembling match,  sat   
  couch far across  room,     light save  
gleaming floor bounced    hall.

When Klipspringer  played “The Love Nest”  turned around  
bench  searched unhappily  Gatsby   gloom.

“I’    practice,  see. I told  I ’ play. I’ 
  prac—”

“Don’ talk  much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”

 “In  morning, In  evening, Ain’  got fun—”

Outside  wind  loud     faint flow  thunder along
 Sound. All  lights  going   West Egg ;  electric
trains, men-carrying,  plunging home   rain  New
York. It   hour   profound human change,  excitement 
generating   air.

 “One thing’ sure  nothing’ surer The rich get richer  
 poor get—children. In  meantime, In  time—”

As I went   say goodbye I saw   expression 
bewilderment  come back  Gatsby’ face,  though  faint doubt
 occurred      quality   present happiness. Almost
five years! There must   moments even  afternoon 
Daisy tumbled short   dreams—    fault, 
   colossal vitality   illusion. It  gone beyond
, beyond everything. He  thrown      creative
passion, adding     time, decking    every bright
feather  drifted  way. No amount  fire  freshness 
challenge   man  store    ghostly heart.

As I watched   adjusted   little, visibly. His hand took
hold  ,    said something low   ear  turned
toward    rush  emotion. I think  voice held  ,
  fluctuating, feverish warmth,   ’ 
-dreamed— voice   deathless song.

They  forgotten ,  Daisy glanced   held   hand;
Gatsby ’ know    . I looked      
looked back  , remotely, possessed  intense life. Then I went
   room    marble steps   rain, leaving 
 together.


                                  VI

About  time  ambitious young reporter  New York arrived one
morning  Gatsby’ door  asked     anything  say.

“Anything  say  ?” inquired Gatsby politely.

“Why— statement  give .”

It transpired   confused five minutes   man  heard
Gatsby’ name around  office   connection   either
’ reveal  ’ fully understand. This   day  
 laudable initiative   hurried  “ see.”

It   random shot,  yet  reporter’ instinct  right.
Gatsby’ notoriety, spread    hundreds   accepted 
hospitality   become authorities upon  past,  increased 
summer   fell  short   news. Contemporary legends
   “underground pipeline  Canada” attached  
,    one persistent story   ’ live   house
 ,    boat  looked like  house   moved secretly
    Long Island shore. Just   inventions  
source  satisfaction  James Gatz  North Dakota, ’ easy 
say.

James Gatz—  really,   least legally,  name. He 
changed    age  seventeen    specific moment 
witnessed  beginning   career—  saw Dan Cody’ yacht
drop anchor    insidious flat  Lake Superior. It 
James Gatz    loafing along  beach  afternoon  
torn green jersey   pair  canvas pants,    already Jay
Gatsby  borrowed  rowboat, pulled    Tuolomee, 
informed Cody   wind might catch   break    half 
hour.

I suppose ’   name ready   long time, even . His
parents  shiftless  unsuccessful farm people— imagination
 never really accepted    parents  . The truth 
 Jay Gatsby  West Egg, Long Island, sprang   Platonic
conception  . He   son  God— phrase ,   means
anything, means  —  must   His Father’ business,
 service   vast, vulgar,  meretricious beauty. So  invented
  sort  Jay Gatsby   seventeen-year-old boy would 
likely  invent,    conception   faithful   end.

For   year    beating  way along  south shore 
Lake Superior   clam-digger   salmon-fisher    
capacity  brought  food  bed. His brown, hardening body
lived naturally   half-fierce, half-lazy work   bracing
days. He knew women early,  since  spoiled   became
contemptuous  ,  young virgins    ignorant, 
 others    hysterical  things   
overwhelming self-absorption  took  granted.

But  heart    constant, turbulent riot. The  grotesque
 fantastic conceits haunted    bed  night. A universe 
ineffable gaudiness spun     brain   clock
ticked   washstand   moon soaked  wet light  tangled
clothes upon  floor. Each night  added   pattern  
fancies  drowsiness closed  upon  vivid scene  
oblivious embrace. For    reveries provided  outlet 
 imagination;    satisfactory hint   unreality 
reality,  promise   rock   world  founded securely 
 fairy’ wing.

An instinct toward  future glory  led ,  months ,
  small Lutheran College  St. Olaf’  southern Minnesota. He
stayed  two weeks, dismayed   ferocious indifference  
drums   destiny,  destiny ,  despising  janitor’
work      pay  way . Then  drifted back 
Lake Superior,    still searching  something    
day  Dan Cody’ yacht dropped anchor   shallows alongshore.

Cody  fifty years old ,  product   Nevada silver fields,
  Yukon,  every rush  metal since seventy-five. The
transactions  Montana copper  made  many times  millionaire
found  physically robust    verge  soft-mindedness, ,
suspecting ,  infinite number  women tried  separate

 newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon   weakness 
sent   sea   yacht,  common property   turgid
journalism  1902. He   coasting along   hospitable
shores  five years   turned   James Gatz’ destiny 
Little Girl Bay.

To young Gatz, resting   oars  looking    railed deck,
 yacht represented   beauty  glamour   world. I
suppose  smiled  Cody—  probably discovered  people liked
   smiled. At  rate Cody asked    questions (one 
 elicited  brand new name)  found    quick 
extravagantly ambitious. A  days later  took   Duluth 
bought   blue coat, six pairs  white duck trousers,  
yachting cap. And   Tuolomee left   West Indies  
Barbary Coast, Gatsby left .

He  employed   vague personal capacity—  remained 
Cody    turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary,  even
jailor,  Dan Cody sober knew  lavish doings Dan Cody drunk
might soon  ,   provided   contingencies 
reposing    trust  Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five
years,    boat went three times around  Continent.
It might  lasted indefinitely except   fact  Ella Kaye
came  board one night  Boston   week later Dan Cody
inhospitably died.

I remember  portrait     Gatsby’ bedroom,  grey, florid
man   hard, empty face— pioneer debauchee,   one
phase  American life brought back   Eastern seaboard  savage
violence   frontier brothel  saloon. It  indirectly due 
Cody  Gatsby drank  little. Sometimes   course  gay

formed  habit  letting liquor alone.

And    Cody   inherited money— legacy  twenty-five
thousand dollars. He ’ get . He never understood  legal

He told     much later,  I’ put    
 idea  exploding  first wild rumours   antecedents,
 ’ even faintly true. Moreover  told      time
 confusion,  I  reached  point  believing everything 
nothing  . So I take advantage   short halt, 
Gatsby,   speak, caught  breath,  clear  set

It   halt, ,   association   affairs. For several
weeks I ’ see   hear  voice   phone—mostly I  
New York, trotting around  Jordan  trying  ingratiate 
  senile aunt— finally I went    house one Sunday
afternoon. I ’   two minutes  somebody brought Tom
Buchanan    drink. I  startled, naturally,   really
surprising thing    ’ happened .

They   party  three  horseback—Tom   man named Sloane 
 pretty woman   brown riding-habit,     previously.

“I’ delighted  see ,” said Gatsby, standing   porch. “I’
delighted   dropped .”

As though  cared!

“Sit right . Have  cigarette   cigar.” He walked around 
room quickly, ringing bells. “I’  something  drink   
  minute.”

He  profoundly affected   fact  Tom  . But 
would  uneasy anyhow    given  something, realizing 
 vague way      came . Mr. Sloane wanted
nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing  ,
thanks … I’ sorry—

“Did    nice ride?”

“Very good roads around .”

“I suppose  automobiles—”

“Yeah.”

Moved   irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned  Tom,  
accepted  introduction   stranger.

“I believe ’ met somewhere , Mr. Buchanan.”

“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite,  obviously  remembering.
“So  . I remember  well.”

“About two weeks ago.”

“That’ right. You   Nick .”

“I know  wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.

“That ?”

Tom turned  .

“You live near , Nick?”

“Next door.”

“That ?”

Mr. Sloane ’ enter   conversation,  lounged back
haughtily   chair;  woman said nothing either—
unexpectedly,  two highballs,  became cordial.

“We’  come    next party, Mr. Gatsby,”  suggested.
“What   say?”

“Certainly; I’  delighted   .”

“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought
  starting home.”

“Please ’ hurry,” Gatsby urged . He  control  
,   wanted  see   Tom. “Why ’ — ’ 
stay  supper? I ’  surprised    people dropped
  New York.”

“You come  supper  ,” said  lady enthusiastically. “Both 
.”

This included . Mr. Sloane got   feet.

“Come along,”  said—   .

“I mean ,”  insisted. “I’ love   . Lots  room.”

Gatsby looked   questioningly. He wanted  go   ’ see
 Mr. Sloane  determined  ’.

“I’ afraid I ’  able ,” I said.

“Well,  come,”  urged, concentrating  Gatsby.

Mr. Sloane murmured something close   ear.

“We ’  late   start ,”  insisted aloud.

“I ’ got  horse,” said Gatsby. “I used  ride   army, 
I’ never bought  horse. I’   follow    car. Excuse
    minute.”

The rest  us walked    porch,  Sloane   lady
began  impassioned conversation aside.

“My God, I believe  man’ coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’  know 
’ want ?”

“She says   want .”

“She   big dinner party   ’ know  soul .” He
frowned. “I wonder    devil  met Daisy. By God, I may 
old-fashioned   ideas,  women run around  much  days 
suit . They meet  kinds  crazy fish.”

Suddenly Mr. Sloane   lady walked   steps  mounted
 horses.

“Come ,” said Mr. Sloane  Tom, “’ late. We’ got  go.”  And
  : “Tell   ’ wait,  ?”

Tom  I shook hands,  rest  us exchanged  cool nod,  
trotted quickly   drive, disappearing   August foliage
  Gatsby,  hat  light overcoat  hand, came  
front door.

Tom  evidently perturbed  Daisy’ running around alone,  
 following Saturday night  came    Gatsby’
party. Perhaps  presence gave  evening  peculiar quality 
oppressiveness— stands    memory  Gatsby’  parties
 summer. There    people,   least   sort 
people,   profusion  champagne,   many-coloured,
many-keyed commotion,  I felt  unpleasantness   air, 
pervading harshness  ’   . Or perhaps I 
merely grown used  , grown  accept West Egg   world complete
 ,    standards    great figures, second 
nothing     consciousness   ,   I 
looking   ,  Daisy’ eyes. It  invariably saddening
 look  new eyes  things upon    expended 
 powers  adjustment.

They arrived  twilight, ,   strolled  among  sparkling
hundreds, Daisy’ voice  playing murmurous tricks   throat.

“These things excite  ,”  whispered. “If  want  kiss 
 time   evening, Nick,  let  know  I’  glad
 arrange   . Just mention  name. Or present  green card.
I’ giving  green—”

“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.

“I’ looking around. I’   marvellous—”

“You must see  faces  many people ’ heard .”

Tom’ arrogant eyes roamed  crowd.

“We ’ go around  much,”  said; “ fact, I   thinking
I ’ know  soul .”

“Perhaps  know  lady.” Gatsby indicated  gorgeous, scarcely
human orchid   woman  sat  state   white-plum tree. Tom
 Daisy stared,   peculiarly unreal feeling  accompanies
 recognition   hitherto ghostly celebrity   movies.

“She’ lovely,” said Daisy.

“The man bending     director.”

He took  ceremoniously  group  group:

“Mrs. Buchanan …  Mr. Buchanan—” After  instant’ hesitation 
added: “ polo player.”

“Oh ,” objected Tom quickly, “ .”

But evidently  sound   pleased Gatsby  Tom remained “
polo player”   rest   evening.

“I’ never met  many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked 
man—   name?—  sort  blue nose.”

Gatsby identified , adding     small producer.

“Well, I liked  anyhow.”

“I’  little rather    polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,
“I’ rather look    famous people — oblivion.”

Daisy  Gatsby danced. I remember  surprised   graceful,
conservative foxtrot—I  never seen  dance . Then 
sauntered    house  sat   steps  half  hour,
   request I remained watchfully   garden. “In case
’  fire   flood,”  explained, “  act  God.”

Tom appeared   oblivion    sitting   supper
together. “Do  mind  I eat   people  ?” 
said. “A fellow’ getting   funny stuff.”

“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “   want  take  
addresses ’  little gold pencil.” … She looked around  
moment  told   girl  “common  pretty,”  I knew 
except   half-hour ’  alone  Gatsby  ’
  good time.

We    particularly tipsy table. That   fault—Gatsby 
 called   phone,  I’ enjoyed   people  two
weeks . But   amused   turned septic   air
.

“How   feel, Miss Baedeker?”

The girl addressed  trying, unsuccessfully,  slump  
shoulder. At  inquiry  sat   opened  eyes.

“Wha’?”

A massive  lethargic woman,    urging Daisy  play golf
    local club tomorrow, spoke  Miss Baedeker’ defence:

“Oh, ’  right . When ’  five  six cocktails 
always starts screaming like . I tell   ought  leave 
alone.”

“I  leave  alone,” affirmed  accused hollowly.

“We heard  yelling,  I said  Doc Civet : ‘There’ somebody
 needs  help, Doc.’ ”

“She’ much obliged, I’ sure,” said another friend, without
gratitude, “  got  dress  wet   stuck  head 
 pool.”

“Anything I hate   get  head stuck   pool,” mumbled Miss
Baedeker. “They almost drowned     New Jersey.”

“Then  ought  leave  alone,” countered Doctor Civet.

“Speak  !” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand
shakes. I ’ let  operate  !”

It  like . Almost  last thing I remember  standing 
Daisy  watching  moving-picture director   Star. They 
still   white-plum tree   faces  touching except
  pale, thin ray  moonlight . It occurred    
   slowly bending toward   evening  attain 
proximity,  even  I watched I saw  stoop one ultimate
degree  kiss   cheek.

“I like ,” said Daisy, “I think ’ lovely.”

But  rest offended — inarguably   ’  gesture
  emotion. She  appalled  West Egg,  unprecedented
“place”  Broadway  begotten upon  Long Island fishing
village—appalled   raw vigour  chafed   old
euphemisms     obtrusive fate  herded  inhabitants
along  shortcut  nothing  nothing. She saw something awful 
  simplicity  failed  understand.

I sat   front steps     waited   car.
It  dark   front;   bright door sent ten square feet
 light volleying    soft black morning. Sometimes  shadow
moved   dressing-room blind , gave way  another shadow,
 indefinite procession  shadows,  rouged  powdered  
invisible glass.

“Who   Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big
bootlegger?”

“Where’  hear ?” I inquired.

“I ’ hear . I imagined . A lot   newly rich people 
 big bootleggers,  know.”

“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.

He  silent   moment. The pebbles   drive crunched 
 feet.

“Well,  certainly must  strained   get  menagerie
together.”

A breeze stirred  grey haze  Daisy’ fur collar.

“At least    interesting   people  know,”  said
  effort.

“You ’ look  interested.”

“Well, I .”

Tom laughed  turned  .

“Did  notice Daisy’ face   girl asked   put  
 cold shower?”

Daisy began  sing   music   husky, rhythmic whisper,
bringing   meaning   word    never   
would never  . When  melody rose  voice broke 
sweetly, following ,   way contralto voices ,   change
tipped   little   warm human magic upon  air.

“Lots  people come  ’  invited,”  said
suddenly. “That girl ’  invited. They simply force  way
  ’  polite  object.”

“I’ like  know       ,” insisted Tom. “And I
think I’ make  point  finding .”

“I  tell  right ,”  answered. “He owned  drugstores, 
lot  drugstores. He built   .”

The dilatory limousine came rolling   drive.

“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.

Her glance left   sought  lighted top   steps, 
“Three O’Clock   Morning,”  neat, sad little waltz   year,
 drifting   open door. After ,    casualness 
Gatsby’ party   romantic possibilities totally absent 
 world. What       song  seemed   calling
 back inside? What would happen    dim, incalculable hours?
Perhaps  unbelievable guest would arrive,  person infinitely rare
   marvelled ,  authentically radiant young girl  
one fresh glance  Gatsby, one moment  magical encounter, would
blot   five years  unwavering devotion.

I stayed late  night. Gatsby asked   wait    free,
 I lingered   garden   inevitable swimming party 
run , chilled  exalted,   black beach,   lights
 extinguished   guestrooms overhead. When  came  
steps  last  tanned skin  drawn unusually tight   face,
  eyes  bright  tired.

“She ’ like ,”  said immediately.

“Of course  .”

“She ’ like ,”  insisted. “She ’   good time.”

He  silent,  I guessed   unutterable depression.

“I feel far away  ,”  said. “It’ hard  make 
understand.”

“You mean   dance?”

“The dance?” He dismissed   dances   given   snap 
 fingers. “Old sport,  dance  unimportant.”

He wanted nothing less  Daisy     go  Tom 
say: “I never loved .” After   obliterated four years 
 sentence  could decide upon   practical measures  
taken. One    ,    free,    go back
 Louisville   married   house—     five
years ago.

“And  ’ understand,”  said. “She used   able 
understand. We’ sit  hours—”

He broke   began  walk     desolate path  fruit
rinds  discarded favours  crushed flowers.

“I ’ ask  much  ,” I ventured. “You ’ repeat 
past.”

“Can’ repeat  past?”  cried incredulously. “Why  course 
!”

He looked around  wildly,    past  lurking   
shadow   house,    reach   hand.

“I’ going  fix everything   way   ,”  said,
nodding determinedly. “She’ see.”

He talked  lot   past,  I gathered   wanted 
recover something,  idea   perhaps,   gone 
loving Daisy. His life   confused  disordered since ,
   could  return   certain starting place  go  
 slowly,  could find    thing  …

… One autumn night, five years ,    walking  
street   leaves  falling,   came   place 
   trees   sidewalk  white  moonlight. They
stopped   turned toward  . Now    cool night
  mysterious excitement    comes   two changes
  year. The quiet lights   houses  humming   
darkness     stir  bustle among  stars. Out  
corner   eye Gatsby saw   blocks   sidewalks really
formed  ladder  mounted   secret place   trees— could
climb  ,   climbed alone,     could suck  
pap  life, gulp   incomparable milk  wonder.

His heart beat faster  Daisy’ white face came    . He
knew    kissed  girl,  forever wed  unutterable
visions   perishable breath,  mind would never romp  like
 mind  God. So  waited, listening   moment longer  
tuning-fork    struck upon  star. Then  kissed . At
 lips’ touch  blossomed   like  flower  
incarnation  complete.

Through   said, even   appalling sentimentality, I 
reminded  something— elusive rhythm,  fragment  lost words,
 I  heard somewhere  long time ago. For  moment  phrase
tried  take shape   mouth   lips parted like  dumb man’,
 though    struggling upon    wisp  startled
air. But  made  sound,   I  almost remembered 
uncommunicable forever.


                                 VII

It   curiosity  Gatsby    highest   lights
  house failed  go  one Saturday night—,  obscurely 
  begun,  career  Trimalchio  . Only gradually  I
become aware   automobiles  turned expectantly  
drive stayed    minute   drove sulkily away. Wondering
   sick I went   find — unfamiliar butler  
villainous face squinted   suspiciously   door.

“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”

“Nope.” After  pause  added “sir”   dilatory, grudging way.

“I ’ seen  around,  I  rather worried. Tell  Mr.
Carraway came .”

“Who?”  demanded rudely.

“Carraway.”

“Carraway. All right, I’ tell .”

Abruptly  slammed  door.

My Finn informed   Gatsby  dismissed every servant  
house  week ago  replaced   half  dozen others,  never
went  West Egg village   bribed   tradesmen,  ordered
moderate supplies   telephone. The grocery boy reported 
 kitchen looked like  pigsty,   general opinion  
village    new people ’ servants  .

Next day Gatsby called    phone.

“Going away?” I inquired.

“No, old sport.”

“I hear  fired   servants.”

“I wanted somebody  ’ gossip. Daisy comes  quite
often—  afternoons.”

So  whole caravansary  fallen  like  card house  
disapproval   eyes.

“They’  people Wolfshiem wanted   something . They’ 
brothers  sisters. They used  run  small hotel.”

“I see.”

He  calling   Daisy’ request—would I come  lunch  
house tomorrow? Miss Baker would  . Half  hour later Daisy
 telephoned  seemed relieved  find  I 
coming. Something  . And yet I ’ believe   would
choose  occasion   scene—especially   rather harrowing
scene  Gatsby  outlined   garden.

The next day  broiling, almost  last, certainly  warmest, 
 summer. As  train emerged   tunnel  sunlight, 
 hot whistles   National Biscuit Company broke  simmering
hush  noon. The straw seats   car hovered   edge 
combustion;  woman next   perspired delicately    
 white shirtwaist,  ,   newspaper dampened  
fingers, lapsed despairingly  deep heat   desolate cry. Her
pocketbook slapped   floor.

“Oh, !”  gasped.

I picked     weary bend  handed  back  , holding 
 arm’ length    extreme tip   corners  indicate 
I   designs upon — everyone near , including  woman,
suspected    .

“Hot!” said  conductor  familiar faces. “Some weather! … Hot! …
Hot! … Hot! … Is  hot enough  ? Is  hot? Is  … ?”

My commutation ticket came back     dark stain   hand.
That anyone  care   heat whose flushed lips  kissed,
whose head made damp  pyjama pocket   heart!

… Through  hall   Buchanans’ house blew  faint wind, carrying
 sound   telephone bell   Gatsby     waited 
 door.

“The master’ body?” roared  butler   mouthpiece. “I’
sorry, madame,   ’ furnish —’ far  hot  touch 
noon!”

What  really said : “Yes … Yes … I’ see.”

He set   receiver  came toward us, glistening slightly, 
take  stiff straw hats.

“Madame expects    salon!”  cried, needlessly indicating 
direction. In  heat every extra gesture   affront  
common store  life.

The room, shadowed well  awnings,  dark  cool. Daisy 
Jordan lay upon  enormous couch, like silver idols weighing 
  white dresses   singing breeze   fans.

“We ’ move,”  said together.

Jordan’ fingers, powdered white   tan, rested   moment
 mine.

“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan,  athlete?” I inquired.

Simultaneously I heard  voice, gruff, muffled, husky,   hall
telephone.

Gatsby stood   centre   crimson carpet  gazed around 
fascinated eyes. Daisy watched   laughed,  sweet, exciting
laugh;  tiny gust  powder rose   bosom   air.

“The rumour ,” whispered Jordan, “ ’ Tom’ girl  
telephone.”

We  silent. The voice   hall rose high  annoyance: “Very
well, , I ’ sell   car   … I’   obligations
    …     bothering     lunch time, I
’ stand   !”

“Holding   receiver,” said Daisy cynically.

“No, ’ ,” I assured . “It’  bona-fide deal. I happen 
know  .”

Tom flung open  door, blocked   space   moment  
thick body,  hurried   room.

“Mr. Gatsby!” He put   broad, flat hand  well-concealed
dislike. “I’ glad  see , sir … Nick …”

“Make us  cold drink,” cried Daisy.

As  left  room   got   went   Gatsby 
pulled  face , kissing    mouth.

“You know I love ,”  murmured.

“You forget ’  lady present,” said Jordan.

Daisy looked around doubtfully.

“You kiss Nick .”

“What  low, vulgar girl!”

“I ’ care!” cried Daisy,  began  clog   brick fireplace.
Then  remembered  heat  sat  guiltily   couch 
  freshly laundered nurse leading  little girl came   room.

“Bles-sed pre-cious,”  crooned, holding   arms. “Come  
 mother  loves .”

The child, relinquished   nurse, rushed across  room 
rooted shyly   mother’ dress.

“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder   old yellowy
hair? Stand  ,  say—How-de-.”

Gatsby  I  turn leaned   took  small reluctant hand.
Afterward  kept looking   child  surprise. I ’ think 
 ever really believed   existence .

“I got dressed  luncheon,” said  child, turning eagerly 
Daisy.

“That’   mother wanted  show  .” Her face bent
  single wrinkle   small white neck. “You dream, . You
absolute little dream.”

“Yes,” admitted  child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’ got   white dress
.”

“How   like mother’ friends?” Daisy turned  around  
 faced Gatsby. “Do  think ’ pretty?”

“Where’ Daddy?”

“She ’ look like  father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like
. She’ got  hair  shape   face.”

Daisy sat back upon  couch. The nurse took  step forward  held
  hand.

“Come, Pammy.”

“Goodbye, sweetheart!”

With  reluctant backward glance  well-disciplined child held 
 nurse’ hand   pulled   door,   Tom came back,
preceding four gin rickeys  clicked full  ice.

Gatsby took   drink.

“They certainly look cool,”  said,  visible tension.

We drank  long, greedy swallows.

“I read somewhere   sun’ getting hotter every year,” said Tom
genially. “It seems  pretty soon  earth’ going  fall 
 sun— wait  minute—’   opposite— sun’ getting
colder every year.

“Come outside,”  suggested  Gatsby, “I’ like     look
  place.”

I went      veranda. On  green Sound, stagnant 
 heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward  fresher sea.
Gatsby’ eyes followed  momentarily;  raised  hand  pointed
across  bay.

“I’ right across  .”

“So  .”

Our eyes lifted   rose-beds   hot lawn   weedy
refuse   dog-days alongshore. Slowly  white wings   boat
moved   blue cool limit   sky. Ahead lay  scalloped
ocean   abounding blessed isles.

“There’ sport  ,” said Tom, nodding. “I’ like    
     hour.”

We  luncheon   dining-room, darkened    heat, 
drank  nervous gaiety   cold ale.

“What’      afternoon?” cried Daisy, “ 
day  ,   next thirty years?”

“Don’  morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts     
gets crisp   fall.”

“But ’  hot,” insisted Daisy,   verge  tears, “
everything’  confused. Let’  go  town!”

Her voice struggled    heat, beating  , moulding
 senselessness  forms.

“I’ heard  making  garage    stable,” Tom  saying 
Gatsby, “ I’  first man  ever made  stable   
garage.”

“Who wants  go  town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’ eyes
floated toward . “Ah,”  cried, “ look  cool.”

Their eyes met,   stared together   , alone 
space. With  effort  glanced    table.

“You always look  cool,”  repeated.

She  told    loved ,  Tom Buchanan saw. He 
astounded. His mouth opened  little,   looked  Gatsby, 
 back  Daisy      recognized   someone  knew
 long time ago.

“You resemble  advertisement   man,”  went  innocently.
“You know  advertisement   man—”

“All right,” broke  Tom quickly, “I’ perfectly willing  go 
town. Come —’  going  town.”

He got ,  eyes still flashing  Gatsby   wife. No one
moved.

“Come !” His temper cracked  little. “What’  matter, anyhow?
If ’ going  town, let’ start.”

His hand, trembling   effort  self-control, bore   lips
 last   glass  ale. Daisy’ voice got us   feet  
   blazing gravel drive.

“Are   going  go?”  objected. “Like ? Aren’  going
 let anyone smoke  cigarette first?”

“Everybody smoked   lunch.”

“Oh, let’  fun,”  begged . “It’  hot  fuss.”

He ’ answer.

“Have    way,”  said. “Come , Jordan.”

They went upstairs  get ready   three men stood 
shuffling  hot pebbles   feet. A silver curve   moon
hovered already   western sky. Gatsby started  speak, changed
 mind,    Tom wheeled  faced  expectantly.

“Have  got  stables ?” asked Gatsby   effort.

“About  quarter   mile   road.”

“Oh.”

A pause.

“I ’ see  idea  going  town,” broke  Tom savagely.
“Women get  notions   heads—”

“Shall  take anything  drink?” called Daisy   upper window.

“I’ get  whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.

Gatsby turned   rigidly:

“I ’ say anything   house, old sport.”

“She’ got  indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’ full —” I
hesitated.

“Her voice  full  money,”  said suddenly.

That  . I’ never understood . It  full  money—
  inexhaustible charm  rose  fell  ,  jingle 
,  cymbals’ song   … High   white palace  king’
daughter,  golden girl …

Tom came    house wrapping  quart bottle   towel, followed
 Daisy  Jordan wearing small tight hats  metallic cloth 
carrying light capes   arms.

“Shall   go   car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt  hot, green
leather   seat. “I ought   left    shade.”

“Is  standard shift?” demanded Tom.

“Yes.”

“Well,  take  coupé  let  drive  car  town.”

The suggestion  distasteful  Gatsby.

“I ’ think ’ much gas,”  objected.

“Plenty  gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked   gauge. “And
  runs  I  stop   drugstore. You  buy anything  
drugstore nowadays.”

A pause followed  apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked  Tom
frowning,   indefinable expression,   definitely unfamiliar
 vaguely recognizable,   I   heard  described 
words, passed  Gatsby’ face.

“Come , Daisy” said Tom, pressing    hand toward Gatsby’
car. “I’ take    circus wagon.”

He opened  door,   moved    circle   arm.

“You take Nick  Jordan. We’ follow    coupé.”

She walked close  Gatsby, touching  coat   hand. Jordan
 Tom  I got   front seat  Gatsby’ car, Tom pushed 
unfamiliar gears tentatively,   shot    oppressive
heat, leaving    sight behind.

“Did  see ?” demanded Tom.

“See ?”

He looked   keenly, realizing  Jordan  I must  known
 along.

“You think I’ pretty dumb, ’ ?”  suggested. “Perhaps I ,
 I  —almost  second sight, sometimes,  tells   
. Maybe  ’ believe ,  science—”

He paused. The immediate contingency overtook , pulled  back
  edge  theoretical abyss.

“I’ made  small investigation   fellow,”  continued. “I
could  gone deeper  I’ known—”

“Do  mean ’    medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.

“What?” Confused,  stared  us   laughed. “A medium?”

“About Gatsby.”

“About Gatsby! No, I ’. I said I’  making  small
investigation   past.”

“And  found    Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.

“An Oxford man!” He  incredulous. “Like hell  ! He wears  pink
suit.”

“Nevertheless ’  Oxford man.”

“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “ something like
.”

“Listen, Tom. If ’   snob,    invite   lunch?”
demanded Jordan crossly.

“Daisy invited ;  knew     married—God knows
!”

We   irritable    fading ale,  aware   
drove     silence. Then  Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’ faded
eyes came  sight   road, I remembered Gatsby’ caution
 gasoline.

“We’ got enough  get us  town,” said Tom.

“But ’  garage right ,” objected Jordan. “I ’ want 
get stalled   baking heat.”

Tom threw   brakes impatiently,   slid   abrupt dusty
stop  Wilson’ sign. After  moment  proprietor emerged 
 interior   establishment  gazed hollow-eyed   car.

“Let’   gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What   think 
stopped — admire  view?”

“I’ sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick  day.”

“What’  matter?”

“I’  run .”

“Well, shall I help ?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough 
 phone.”

With  effort Wilson left  shade  support   doorway ,
breathing hard, unscrewed  cap   tank. In  sunlight 
face  green.

“I ’ mean  interrupt  lunch,”  said. “But I need money
pretty bad,  I  wondering    going    
old car.”

“How   like  one?” inquired Tom. “I bought  last week.”

“It’  nice yellow one,” said Wilson,   strained   handle.

“Like  buy ?”

“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No,  I could make  money
  .”

“What   want money ,    sudden?”

“I’    long. I want  get away. My wife  I want  go
West.”

“Your wife ,” exclaimed Tom, startled.

“She’  talking    ten years.” He rested   moment
  pump, shading  eyes. “And  ’ going whether 
wants   . I’ going  get  away.”

The coupé flashed  us   flurry  dust   flash  
waving hand.

“What  I owe ?” demanded Tom harshly.

“I  got wised   something funny  last two days,” remarked
Wilson. “That’  I want  get away. That’  I  bothering
   car.”

“What  I owe ?”

“Dollar twenty.”

The relentless beating heat  beginning  confuse   I  
bad moment   I realized   far  suspicions ’
alighted  Tom. He  discovered  Myrtle   sort  life
apart    another world,   shock  made  physically
sick. I stared      Tom,   made  parallel
discovery less   hour —  occurred    
  difference  men,  intelligence  race,  profound 
 difference   sick   well. Wilson   sick 
 looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—     got  poor
girl  child.

“I’ let    car,” said Tom. “I’ send   tomorrow
afternoon.”

That locality  always vaguely disquieting, even   broad glare
 afternoon,   I turned  head  though I   warned 
something behind. Over  ash-heaps  giant eyes  Doctor T. J.
Eckleburg kept  vigil,  I perceived,   moment, 
 eyes  regarding us  peculiar intensity  less 
twenty feet away.

In one   windows   garage  curtains   moved
aside  little,  Myrtle Wilson  peering    car. So
engrossed       consciousness   observed, 
one emotion  another crept   face like objects  
slowly developing picture. Her expression  curiously familiar—
  expression I  often seen  women’ faces,   Myrtle
Wilson’ face  seemed purposeless  inexplicable  I realized
  eyes, wide  jealous terror,  fixed   Tom,  
Jordan Baker,   took    wife.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There   confusion like  confusion   simple mind,   
drove away Tom  feeling  hot whips  panic. His wife  
mistress,   hour ago secure  inviolate,  slipping
precipitately   control. Instinct made  step  
accelerator   double purpose  overtaking Daisy  leaving
Wilson behind,   sped along toward Astoria  fifty miles 
hour, , among  spidery girders   elevated,  came 
sight   easygoing blue coupé.

“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street  cool,” suggested
Jordan. “I love New York  summer afternoons  everyone’ away.
There’ something  sensuous  —overripe,    sorts 
funny fruits  going  fall   hands.”

The word “sensuous”   effect   disquieting Tom, 
  could invent  protest  coupé came   stop,  Daisy
signalled us  draw  alongside.

“Where   going?”  cried.

“How   movies?”

“It’  hot,”  complained. “You go. We’ ride around  meet 
.” With  effort  wit rose faintly. “We’ meet   
corner. I’   man smoking two cigarettes.”

“We ’ argue   ,” Tom said impatiently,   truck gave
  cursing whistle behind us. “You follow    south side 
Central Park,  front   Plaza.”

Several times  turned  head  looked back   car,  
 traffic delayed   slowed    came  sight. I
think   afraid  would dart   side-street    
life forever.

But  ’. And   took  less explicable step  engaging
 parlour   suite   Plaza Hotel.

The prolonged  tumultuous argument  ended  herding us 
 room eludes , though I   sharp physical memory , 
 course  ,  underwear kept climbing like  damp snake around
 legs  intermittent beads  sweat raced cool across  back.
The notion originated  Daisy’ suggestion   hire five
bathrooms  take cold baths,   assumed  tangible form 
“ place    mint julep.” Each  us said     
  “crazy idea”—  talked     baffled clerk 
thought,  pretended  think,      funny …

The room  large  stifling, , though   already four
’clock, opening  windows admitted   gust  hot shrubbery
  Park. Daisy went   mirror  stood   back  us,
fixing  hair.

“It’  swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully,  everyone
laughed.

“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.

“There ’  .”

“Well, ’ better telephone   axe—”

“The thing     forget   heat,” said Tom impatiently.
“You make  ten times worse  crabbing  .”

He unrolled  bottle  whisky   towel  put   
table.

“Why  let  alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’  one
 wanted  come  town.”

There   moment  silence. The telephone book slipped  
nail  splashed   floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse
”—  time  one laughed.

“I’ pick  ,” I offered.

“I’ got .” Gatsby examined  parted string, muttered “Hum!” 
 interested way,  tossed  book   chair.

“That’  great expression  , ’ ?” said Tom sharply.

“What ?”

“All  ‘old sport’ business. Where’  pick  ?”

“Now see , Tom,” said Daisy, turning around   mirror, “
’ going  make personal remarks I ’ stay   minute.
Call   order  ice   mint julep.”

As Tom took   receiver  compressed heat exploded  sound
   listening   portentous chords  Mendelssohn’
Wedding March   ballroom .

“Imagine marrying anybody   heat!” cried Jordan dismally.

“Still—I  married   middle  June,” Daisy remembered.
“Louisville  June! Somebody fainted. Who   fainted, Tom?”

“Biloxi,”  answered shortly.

“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi,   made boxes—’ 
fact—    Biloxi, Tennessee.”

“They carried    house,” appended Jordan, “  lived
 two doors   church. And  stayed three weeks,  Daddy
told     get . The day   left Daddy died.”  After
 moment  added. “There ’  connection.”

“I used  know  Bill Biloxi  Memphis,” I remarked.

“That   cousin. I knew  whole family history  
left. He gave   aluminium putter  I use today.”

The music  died    ceremony began    long cheer
floated    window, followed  intermittent cries 
“Yea—ea—ea!”  finally   burst  jazz   dancing began.

“We’ getting old,” said Daisy. “If   young ’ rise 
dance.”

“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned . “Where’  know , Tom?”

“Biloxi?” He concentrated   effort. “I ’ know . He  
friend  Daisy’.”

“He  ,”  denied. “I’ never seen  . He came  
 private car.”

“Well,  said  knew . He said   raised  Louisville. Asa
Bird brought  around   last minute  asked    room
 .”

Jordan smiled.

“He  probably bumming  way home. He told    president 
 class  Yale.”

Tom  I looked    blankly.

“Biloxi?”

“First place,  ’   president—”

Gatsby’ foot beat  short, restless tattoo  Tom eyed  suddenly.

“By  way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand ’  Oxford man.”

“Not exactly.”

“Oh, yes, I understand  went  Oxford.”

“Yes—I went .”

A pause. Then Tom’ voice, incredulous  insulting:

“You must  gone    time Biloxi went  New Haven.”

Another pause. A waiter knocked  came   crushed mint  ice
  silence  unbroken   “thank ”   soft closing
  door. This tremendous detail    cleared   last.

“I told  I went ,” said Gatsby.

“I heard ,  I’ like  know .”

“It   nineteen-nineteen, I  stayed five months. That’  I
’ really call   Oxford man.”

Tom glanced around  see   mirrored  unbelief. But   
looking  Gatsby.

“It   opportunity  gave     officers  
armistice,”  continued. “We could go     universities 
England  France.”

I wanted  get   slap    back. I  one  
renewals  complete faith    I’ experienced .

Daisy rose, smiling faintly,  went   table.

“Open  whisky, Tom,”  ordered, “ I’ make   mint julep.
Then  ’ seem  stupid   … Look   mint!”

“Wait  minute,” snapped Tom, “I want  ask Mr. Gatsby one 
question.”

“Go ,” Gatsby said politely.

“What kind   row   trying  cause   house anyhow?”

They     open  last  Gatsby  content.

“He ’ causing  row,” Daisy looked desperately  one  
. “You’ causing  row. Please   little self-control.”

“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose  latest
thing   sit back  let Mr. Nobody  Nowhere make love  
wife. Well,  ’  idea   count   … Nowadays people
begin  sneering  family life  family institutions,  next
’ throw everything overboard   intermarriage 
black  white.”

Flushed   impassioned gibberish,  saw  standing alone
  last barrier  civilization.

“We’  white ,” murmured Jordan.

“I know I’   popular. I ’ give big parties. I suppose
’ got  make  house   pigsty  order   
friends—  modern world.”

Angry  I ,    , I  tempted  laugh whenever 
opened  mouth. The transition  libertine  prig  
complete.

“I’ got something  tell , old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy
guessed   intention.

“Please ’!”  interrupted helplessly. “Please let’  go
home. Why ’   go home?”

“That’  good idea,” I got . “Come , Tom. Nobody wants  drink.”

“I want  know  Mr. Gatsby   tell .”

“Your wife ’ love ,” said Gatsby. “She’ never loved .
She loves .”

“You must  crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.

Gatsby sprang   feet, vivid  excitement.

“She never loved ,   hear?”  cried. “She  married 
 I  poor    tired  waiting  . It  
terrible mistake,    heart  never loved anyone except !”

At  point Jordan  I tried  go,  Tom  Gatsby insisted
 competitive firmness   remain— though neither   
anything  conceal   would   privilege  partake vicariously
  emotions.

“Sit , Daisy,” Tom’ voice groped unsuccessfully   paternal
note. “What’  going ? I want  hear   .”

“I told  ’  going ,” said Gatsby. “Going   five
years—  ’ know.”

Tom turned  Daisy sharply.

“You’  seeing  fellow  five years?”

“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No,  ’ meet. But   us loved
    time, old sport,   ’ know. I used 
laugh sometimes”—    laughter   eyes—“ think 
 ’ know.”

“Oh—’ .” Tom tapped  thick fingers together like 
clergyman  leaned back   chair.

“You’ crazy!”  exploded. “I ’ speak   happened five
years ago,  I ’ know Daisy — I’  damned  I
see   got within  mile   unless  brought  groceries
  back door. But   rest  ’  God damned lie. Daisy
loved    married    loves  .”

“No,” said Gatsby, shaking  head.

“She , though. The trouble   sometimes  gets foolish
ideas   head  ’ know  ’ .” He nodded
sagely. “And ’ , I love Daisy . Once    I go 
  spree  make  fool  ,  I always come back,  
 heart I love    time.”

“You’ revolting,” said Daisy. She turned  ,   voice,
dropping  octave lower, filled  room  thrilling scorn: “Do
 know   left Chicago? I’ surprised   ’ treat 
  story   little spree.”

Gatsby walked   stood beside .

“Daisy, ’   ,”  said earnestly. “It ’ matter
 . Just tell   truth—  never loved — ’
 wiped  forever.”

She looked   blindly. “Why— could I love —possibly?”

“You never loved .”

She hesitated. Her eyes fell  Jordan     sort  appeal,
 though  realized  last    —  though 
 never,  along, intended  anything  . But   done
. It   late.

“I never loved ,”  said,  perceptible reluctance.

“Not  Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.

“No.”

From  ballroom beneath, muffled  suffocating chords 
drifting   hot waves  air.

“Not  day I carried     Punch Bowl  keep 
shoes dry?” There   husky tenderness   tone … “Daisy?”

“Please ’.” Her voice  cold,   rancour  gone  .
She looked  Gatsby. “There, Jay,”  said—  hand   tried
 light  cigarette  trembling. Suddenly  threw  cigarette
  burning match   carpet.

“Oh,  want  much!”  cried  Gatsby. “I love  —’
 enough? I ’ help ’ past.” She began  sob
helplessly. “I  love  — I loved  .”

Gatsby’ eyes opened  closed.

“You loved  ?”  repeated.

“Even ’  lie,” said Tom savagely. “She ’ know  
alive. Why—’ things  Daisy    ’ never know,
things  neither  us  ever forget.”

The words seemed  bite physically  Gatsby.

“I want  speak  Daisy alone,”  insisted. “She’  excited
—”

“Even alone I ’ say I never loved Tom,”  admitted   pitiful
voice. “It ’  true.”

“Of course  ’,” agreed Tom.

She turned   husband.

“As   mattered  ,”  said.

“Of course  matters. I’ going  take better care    
.”

“You ’ understand,” said Gatsby,   touch  panic. “You’
 going  take care    .”

“I’ ?” Tom opened  eyes wide  laughed. He could afford 
control  . “Why’ ?”

“Daisy’ leaving .”

“Nonsense.”

“I , though,”  said   visible effort.

“She’  leaving !” Tom’ words suddenly leaned   Gatsby.
“Certainly    common swindler ’   steal  ring 
put   finger.”

“I ’ stand !” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’ get .”

“Who  , anyhow?” broke  Tom. “You’ one   bunch 
hangs around  Meyer Wolfshiem— much I happen  know. I’
made  little investigation   affairs— I’ carry 
 tomorrow.”

“You  suit   , old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.

“I found    ‘drugstores’ .” He turned  us  spoke
rapidly. “He   Wolfshiem bought   lot  side-street
drugstores    Chicago  sold grain alcohol  
counter. That’ one   little stunts. I picked   
bootlegger  first time I saw ,  I ’ far wrong.”

“What  ?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess  friend Walter
Chase ’  proud  come   .”

“And  left    lurch, ’ ? You let  go  jail 
 month   New Jersey. God! You ought  hear Walter  
subject  .”

“He came  us dead broke. He   glad  pick   money, old
sport.”

“Don’  call  ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said
nothing. “Walter could      betting laws , 
Wolfshiem scared   shutting  mouth.”

That unfamiliar yet recognizable look  back   Gatsby’ face.

“That drugstore business   small change,” continued Tom slowly,
“ ’ got something    Walter’ afraid  tell 
.”

I glanced  Daisy,   staring terrified  Gatsby  
husband,   Jordan,   begun  balance  invisible 
absorbing object   tip   chin. Then I turned back 
Gatsby—  startled   expression. He looked—   said
  contempt   babbled slander   garden—   
“killed  man.” For  moment  set   face could  described 
  fantastic way.

It passed,   began  talk excitedly  Daisy, denying
everything, defending  name  accusations    
made. But  every word   drawing    
,   gave  ,    dead dream fought   
afternoon slipped away, trying  touch    longer tangible,
struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward  lost voice across
 room.

The voice begged   go.

“Please, Tom! I ’ stand   .”

Her frightened eyes told  whatever intentions, whatever courage
  ,  definitely gone.

“You two start  home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’ car.”

She looked  Tom, alarmed ,   insisted  magnanimous
scorn.

“Go . He ’ annoy . I think  realizes   presumptuous
little flirtation  .”

They  gone, without  word, snapped , made accidental,
isolated, like ghosts, even   pity.

After  moment Tom got   began wrapping  unopened bottle 
whisky   towel.

“Want    stuff? Jordan? … Nick?”

I ’ answer.

“Nick?” He asked .

“What?”

“Want ?”

“No … I  remembered  today’  birthday.”

I  thirty. Before  stretched  portentous, menacing road  
new decade.

It  seven ’clock   got   coupé    started
 Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting  laughing, 
 voice   remote  Jordan     foreign clamour 
 sidewalk   tumult   elevated overhead. Human sympathy
  limits,    content  let   tragic arguments
fade   city lights behind. Thirty— promise   decade 
loneliness,  thinning list  single men  know,  thinning
briefcase  enthusiasm, thinning hair. But   Jordan beside
, , unlike Daisy,   wise ever  carry well-forgotten
dreams  age  age. As  passed   dark bridge  wan face
fell lazily   coat’ shoulder   formidable stroke 
thirty died away   reassuring pressure   hand.

So  drove  toward death   cooling twilight.

The young Greek, Michaelis,  ran  coffee joint beside 
ash-heaps   principal witness   inquest. He  slept
  heat   five,   strolled   
garage,  found George Wilson sick   office—really sick, pale
   pale hair  shaking  . Michaelis advised   go
 bed,  Wilson refused, saying  ’ miss  lot  business 
 . While  neighbour  trying  persuade   violent
racket broke  overhead.

“I’ got  wife locked   ,” explained Wilson calmly.
“She’ going  stay  till  day  tomorrow,   ’
going  move away.”

Michaelis  astonished;    neighbours  four years, 
Wilson  never seemed faintly capable    statement.
Generally   one   worn- men:   ’ working, 
sat   chair   doorway  stared   people   cars
 passed along  road. When anyone spoke    invariably
laughed   agreeable, colourless way. He   wife’ man  
 .

So naturally Michaelis tried  find    happened,  Wilson
’ say  word—instead  began  throw curious, suspicious
glances   visitor  ask   ’    certain
times  certain days. Just   latter  getting uneasy, 
workmen came past  door bound   restaurant,  Michaelis
took  opportunity  get away, intending  come back later. But 
’. He supposed  forgot , ’ . When  came outside
,  little  seven,   reminded   conversation
  heard Mrs. Wilson’ voice, loud  scolding, downstairs 
 garage.

“Beat !”  heard  cry. “Throw    beat ,  dirty
little coward!”

A moment later  rushed    dusk, waving  hands 
shouting—  could move   door  business  .

The “death car”   newspapers called , ’ stop;  came 
  gathering darkness, wavered tragically   moment,  
disappeared around  next bend. Mavro Michaelis ’ even sure 
 colour— told  first policeman    light green. The
 car,  one going toward New York, came  rest  hundred yards
beyond,   driver hurried back   Myrtle Wilson,  life
violently extinguished, knelt   road  mingled  thick dark
blood   dust.

Michaelis   man reached  first,     torn open
 shirtwaist, still damp  perspiration,  saw   left
breast  swinging loose like  flap,     need  listen
  heart beneath. The mouth  wide open  ripped  little 
 corners,  though   choked  little  giving  
tremendous vitality   stored  long.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We saw  three  four automobiles   crowd    still
 distance away.

“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’ good. Wilson’   little business 
last.”

He slowed ,  still without  intention  stopping, , 
 came nearer,  hushed, intent faces   people   garage
door made  automatically put   brakes.

“We’ take  look,”  said doubtfully, “  look.”

I became aware    hollow, wailing sound  issued incessantly
  garage,  sound    got    coupé  walked
toward  door resolved    words “Oh,  God!” uttered
     gasping moan.

“There’  bad trouble ,” said Tom excitedly.

He reached   tiptoes  peered   circle  heads  
garage,   lit    yellow light   swinging metal
basket overhead. Then  made  harsh sound   throat,   
violent thrusting movement   powerful arms pushed  way
.

The circle closed     running murmur  expostulation; 
  minute  I could see anything  . Then new arrivals
deranged  line,  Jordan  I  pushed suddenly inside.

Myrtle Wilson’ body, wrapped   blanket,    another
blanket,  though  suffered   chill   hot night, lay 
 worktable   wall,  Tom,   back  us,  bending
 , motionless. Next   stood  motorcycle policeman taking
 names  much sweat  correction   little book. At first I
’ find  source   high, groaning words  echoed
clamorously   bare garage— I saw Wilson standing  
raised threshold   office, swaying back  forth  holding 
 doorposts   hands. Some man  talking     low
voice  attempting,  time  time,  lay  hand  
shoulder,  Wilson neither heard  saw. His eyes would drop slowly
  swinging light   laden table   wall,   jerk
back   light ,   gave  incessantly  high,
horrible call:

“Oh,  Ga-od! Oh,  Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh,  Ga-od!”

Presently Tom lifted  head   jerk ,  staring around
 garage  glazed eyes, addressed  mumbled incoherent remark 
 policeman.

“M--v—”  policeman  saying, “——”

“No, r—” corrected  man, “M--v-r-—”

“Listen  !” muttered Tom fiercely.

“r—” said  policeman, “—”

“g—”

“g—” He looked   Tom’ broad hand fell sharply   shoulder.
“What  want, fella?”

“What happened?—’  I want  know.”

“Auto hit . Ins’antly killed.”

“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.

“She ran  ina road. Son---bitch ’ even stopus car.”

“There  two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”

“Going ?” asked  policeman keenly.

“One goin’  way. Well, ”— hand rose toward  blankets 
stopped halfway  fell   side—“ ran   ’  one
comin’  N’York knock right  , goin’ thirty  forty miles
 hour.”

“What’  name   place ?” demanded  officer.

“Hasn’ got  name.”

A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.

“It   yellow car,”  said, “big yellow car. New.”

“See  accident?” asked  policeman.

“No,   car passed    road, going faster’n forty. Going
fifty, sixty.”

“Come   let’   name. Look  . I want  get 
name.”

Some words   conversation must  reached Wilson, swaying 
 office door,  suddenly  new theme found voice among 
grasping cries:

“You ’   tell   kind  car  ! I know  kind
 car  !”

Watching Tom, I saw  wad  muscle back   shoulder tighten
  coat. He walked quickly   Wilson , standing 
front  , seized  firmly   upper arms.

“You’ got  pull  together,”  said  soothing
gruffness.

Wilson’ eyes fell upon Tom;  started    tiptoes  
would  collapsed   knees   Tom held  upright.

“Listen,” said Tom, shaking   little. “I  got   minute
ago,  New York. I  bringing   coupé ’  talking
. That yellow car I  driving  afternoon ’ mine— 
hear? I ’ seen   afternoon.”

Only  negro  I  near enough  hear   said,  
policeman caught something   tone  looked   truculent
eyes.

“What’  ?”  demanded.

“I’  friend  .” Tom turned  head  kept  hands firm 
Wilson’ body. “He says  knows  car    … It   yellow
car.”

Some dim impulse moved  policeman  look suspiciously  Tom.

“And  colour’  car?”

“It’  blue car,  coupé.”

“We’ come straight  New York,” I said.

Someone    driving  little behind us confirmed , 
 policeman turned away.

“Now,  ’ let    name  correct—”

Picking  Wilson like  doll, Tom carried    office, set
    chair,  came back.

“If somebody’ come   sit  ,”  snapped
authoritatively. He watched   two men standing closest glanced
    went unwillingly   room. Then Tom shut 
door    came   single step,  eyes avoiding 
table. As  passed close    whispered: “Let’ get .”

Self-consciously,   authoritative arms breaking  way, 
pushed   still gathering crowd, passing  hurried doctor,
case  hand,    sent   wild hope half  hour ago.

Tom drove slowly    beyond  bend—  foot came 
hard,   coupé raced along   night. In  little  I
heard  low husky sob,  saw   tears  overflowing 
 face.

“The God damned coward!”  whimpered. “He ’ even stop  car.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us   dark
rustling trees. Tom stopped beside  porch  looked   
second floor,  two windows bloomed  light among  vines.

“Daisy’ home,”  said. As  got    car  glanced   
frowned slightly.

“I ought   dropped   West Egg, Nick. There’ nothing  
 tonight.”

A change  come  ,   spoke gravely,   decision.
As  walked across  moonlight gravel   porch  disposed 
 situation    brisk phrases.

“I’ telephone   taxi  take  home,   ’ waiting
  Jordan better go   kitchen    get  
supper—  want .” He opened  door. “Come .”

“No, thanks. But I’  glad  ’ order   taxi. I’ wait
outside.”

Jordan put  hand   arm.

“Won’  come , Nick?”

“No, thanks.”

I  feeling  little sick  I wanted   alone. But Jordan
lingered   moment .

“It’  half-past nine,”  said.

I’  damned  I’ go ; I’  enough      one day,
 suddenly  included Jordan . She must  seen something 
   expression,   turned abruptly away  ran  
porch steps   house. I sat     minutes   head
  hands,  I heard  phone taken  inside   butler’
voice calling  taxi. Then I walked slowly   drive away 
 house, intending  wait   gate.

I ’ gone twenty yards  I heard  name  Gatsby stepped
  two bushes   path. I must  felt pretty weird
  time,  I could think  nothing except  luminosity
  pink suit   moon.

“What   ?” I inquired.

“Just standing , old sport.”

Somehow,  seemed  despicable occupation. For  I knew  
going  rob  house   moment; I ’   surprised 
see sinister faces,  faces  “Wolfshiem’ people,” behind  
 dark shrubbery.

“Did  see  trouble   road?”  asked   minute.

“Yes.”

He hesitated.

“Was  killed?”

“Yes.”

“I thought ; I told Daisy I thought . It’ better   shock
  come  . She stood  pretty well.”

He spoke   Daisy’ reaction    thing  mattered.

“I got  West Egg   side road,”  went , “ left  car 
 garage. I ’ think anybody saw us,   course I ’ 
sure.”

I disliked   much   time  I ’ find  necessary 
tell    wrong.

“Who   woman?”  inquired.

“Her name  Wilson. Her husband owns  garage. How  devil 
 happen?”

“Well, I tried  swing  wheel—” He broke ,  suddenly I
guessed   truth.

“Was Daisy driving?”

“Yes,”  said   moment, “  course I’ say I . You see,
  left New York    nervous   thought  would
steady   drive—  woman rushed   us    
passing  car coming   way. It  happened   minute, 
 seemed     wanted  speak  us, thought  
somebody  knew. Well, first Daisy turned away   woman toward
  car,    lost  nerve  turned back. The second
 hand reached  wheel I felt  shock— must  killed 
instantly.”

“It ripped  open—”

“Don’ tell , old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped  . I
tried  make  stop,   ’,  I pulled   emergency
brake. Then  fell    lap  I drove .

“She’   right tomorrow,”  said presently. “I’  going 
wait   see   tries  bother    unpleasantness
 afternoon. She’ locked    room,    tries
 brutality ’ going  turn  light    .”

“He ’ touch ,” I said. “He’  thinking  .”

“I ’ trust , old sport.”

“How long   going  wait?”

“All night,  necessary. Anyhow, till   go  bed.”

A new point  view occurred  . Suppose Tom found   Daisy
  driving. He might think  saw  connection  — might
think anything. I looked   house;   two  three bright
windows downstairs   pink glow  Daisy’ room   ground
floor.

“You wait ,” I said. “I’ see  ’  sign  
commotion.”

I walked back along  border   lawn, traversed  gravel
softly,  tiptoed   veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains
 open,  I saw   room  empty. Crossing  porch 
  dined  June night three months , I came   small
rectangle  light  I guessed   pantry window. The blind
 drawn,  I found  rift   sill.

Daisy  Tom  sitting opposite     kitchen table,
  plate  cold fried chicken  ,  two bottles 
ale. He  talking intently across  table  ,   
earnestness  hand  fallen upon  covered  . Once  
  looked     nodded  agreement.

They ’ happy,  neither    touched  chicken  
ale— yet  ’ unhappy either. There   unmistakable air
 natural intimacy   picture,  anybody would  said
   conspiring together.

As I tiptoed   porch I heard  taxi feeling  way along 
dark road toward  house. Gatsby  waiting  I  left  
 drive.

“Is   quiet  ?”  asked anxiously.

“Yes, ’  quiet.” I hesitated. “You’ better come home  get
 sleep.”

He shook  head.

“I want  wait  till Daisy goes  bed. Good night, old sport.”

He put  hands   coat pockets  turned back eagerly  
scrutiny   house,  though  presence marred  sacredness 
 vigil. So I walked away  left  standing   
moonlight—watching  nothing.


                                 VIII

I ’ sleep  night;  foghorn  groaning incessantly  
Sound,  I tossed half-sick  grotesque reality  savage,
frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard  taxi go  Gatsby’ drive,
 immediately I jumped   bed  began  dress—I felt  I
 something  tell , something  warn  ,  morning
would   late.

Crossing  lawn, I saw   front door  still open   
leaning   table   hall, heavy  dejection  sleep.

“Nothing happened,”  said wanly. “I waited,   four ’clock
 came   window  stood    minute   turned
  light.”

His house  never seemed  enormous       night 
 hunted   great rooms  cigarettes. We pushed aside
curtains   like pavilions,  felt  innumerable feet 
dark wall  electric light switches— I tumbled   sort 
splash upon  keys   ghostly piano. There   inexplicable
amount  dust everywhere,   rooms  musty,  though 
’  aired  many days. I found  humidor   unfamiliar
table,  two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open  French
windows   drawing-room,  sat smoking    darkness.

“You ought  go away,” I said. “It’ pretty certain ’ trace
 car.”

“Go away , old sport?”

“Go  Atlantic City   week,    Montreal.”

He ’ consider . He ’ possibly leave Daisy  
knew    going  . He  clutching   last hope 
I ’ bear  shake  free.

It   night   told   strange story   youth 
Dan Cody—told     “Jay Gatsby”  broken  like glass
 Tom’ hard malice,   long secret extravaganza  played
. I think   would  acknowledged anything , without
reserve,   wanted  talk  Daisy.

She   first “nice” girl   ever known. In various unrevealed
capacities   come  contact   people,  always 
indiscernible barbed wire . He found  excitingly
desirable. He went   house,  first   officers 
Camp Taylor,  alone. It amazed —  never    
beautiful house . But  gave   air  breathless
intensity,   Daisy lived —   casual  thing  
  tent   camp   . There   ripe mystery  ,
 hint  bedrooms upstairs  beautiful  cool  
bedrooms,  gay  radiant activities taking place  
corridors,   romances    musty  laid away already
 lavender  fresh  breathing  redolent   year’
shining motorcars   dances whose flowers  scarcely
withered. It excited , ,  many men  already loved
Daisy— increased  value   eyes. He felt  presence 
  house, pervading  air   shades  echoes  still
vibrant emotions.

But  knew     Daisy’ house   colossal
accident. However glorious might   future  Jay Gatsby,  
 present  penniless young man without  past,    moment 
invisible cloak   uniform might slip   shoulders. So 
made     time. He took   could get, ravenously 
unscrupulously—eventually  took Daisy one still October night, took
     real right  touch  hand.

He might  despised ,    certainly taken  
false pretences. I ’ mean    traded   phantom
millions,    deliberately given Daisy  sense  security; 
let  believe     person  much   strata 
—   fully able  take care  . As  matter 
fact,     facilities—   comfortable family standing
behind ,    liable   whim   impersonal government
  blown anywhere   world.

But  ’ despise    ’ turn    
imagined. He  intended, probably,  take   could  go—
  found    committed    following  
grail. He knew  Daisy  extraordinary,   ’ realize
  extraordinary  “nice” girl could . She vanished  
rich house,   rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt
married  ,   .

When  met , two days later,   Gatsby   breathless,
 , somehow, betrayed. Her porch  bright   bought
luxury  star-shine;  wicker   settee squeaked fashionably 
 turned toward    kissed  curious  lovely mouth. She
 caught  cold,   made  voice huskier   charming
 ever,  Gatsby  overwhelmingly aware   youth 
mystery  wealth imprisons  preserves,   freshness  many
clothes,   Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe  proud  
hot struggles   poor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

“I ’ describe    surprised I   find  I loved ,
old sport. I even hoped     ’ throw  ,  
’,     love   . She thought I knew  lot
 I knew different things   … Well,  I , way 
 ambitions, getting deeper  love every minute,     sudden
I ’ care. What   use   great things  I could 
 better time telling   I  going  ?”

On  last afternoon   went abroad,  sat  Daisy  
arms   long, silent time. It   cold fall day,  fire  
room   cheeks flushed. Now    moved   changed 
arm  little,    kissed  dark shining hair. The afternoon
 made  tranquil   ,    give   deep memory
  long parting  next day promised. They  never  closer
  month  love,  communicated  profoundly one 
another,    brushed silent lips   coat’ shoulder
   touched  end   fingers, gently,  though  
asleep.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He  extraordinarily well   war. He   captain  
went   front,  following  Argonne battles  got 
majority   command   divisional machine-guns. After 
armistice  tried frantically  get home,   complication 
misunderstanding sent   Oxford instead. He  worried —
  quality  nervous despair  Daisy’ letters. She ’ see
  ’ come. She  feeling  pressure   world
outside,   wanted  see   feel  presence beside 
  reassured      right thing  .

For Daisy  young   artificial world  redolent  orchids
 pleasant, cheerful snobbery  orchestras  set  rhythm 
 year, summing   sadness  suggestiveness  life  new
tunes. All night  saxophones wailed  hopeless comment  
“Beale Street Blues”   hundred pairs  golden  silver
slippers shuffled  shining dust. At  grey tea hour  
always rooms  throbbed incessantly   low, sweet fever,
 fresh faces drifted    like rose petals blown  
sad horns around  floor.

Through  twilight universe Daisy began  move   
season; suddenly    keeping half  dozen dates  day 
half  dozen men,  drowsing asleep  dawn   beads 
chiffon   evening-dress tangled among dying orchids   floor
beside  bed. And   time something within   crying  
decision. She wanted  life shaped , immediately—  decision
must  made   force— love,  money,  unquestionable
practicality—  close  hand.

That force took shape   middle  spring   arrival  Tom
Buchanan. There   wholesome bulkiness   person  
position,  Daisy  flattered. Doubtless    certain
struggle   certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby   
still  Oxford.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It  dawn   Long Island   went  opening  rest 
 windows downstairs, filling  house  grey-turning,
gold-turning light. The shadow   tree fell abruptly across  dew
 ghostly birds began  sing among  blue leaves. There  
slow, pleasant movement   air, scarcely  wind, promising  cool,
lovely day.

“I ’ think  ever loved .” Gatsby turned around   window
 looked   challengingly. “You must remember, old sport,  
 excited  afternoon. He told   things   way 
frightened — made  look   I   kind  cheap
sharper. And  result   hardly knew    saying.”

He sat  gloomily.

“Of course  might  loved     minute,   
first married— loved   even ,   see?”

Suddenly  came    curious remark.

“In  case,”  said, “   personal.”

What could  make  , except  suspect  intensity  
conception   affair  ’  measured?

He came back  France  Tom  Daisy  still  
wedding trip,  made  miserable  irresistible journey 
Louisville   last   army pay. He stayed   week,
walking  streets   footsteps  clicked together 
 November night  revisiting  ---way places  
  driven   white car. Just  Daisy’ house  always
seemed    mysterious  gay   houses,   idea
  city , even though   gone  ,  pervaded
  melancholy beauty.

He left feeling     searched harder,  might  found
—   leaving  behind. The day-coach—  penniless
— hot. He went    open vestibule  sat   
folding-chair,   station slid away   backs  unfamiliar
buildings moved . Then    spring fields,   yellow
trolley raced    minute  people    might  
seen  pale magic   face along  casual street.

The track curved     going away   sun, ,  
sank lower, seemed  spread   benediction   vanishing
city    drawn  breath. He stretched   hand
desperately    snatch   wisp  air,  save  fragment 
 spot    made lovely  . But    going  
fast    blurred eyes   knew    lost  part
 ,  freshest   best, forever.

It  nine ’clock   finished breakfast  went   
porch. The night  made  sharp difference   weather  
  autumn flavour   air. The gardener,  last one 
Gatsby’ former servants, came   foot   steps.

“I’ going  drain  pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ start
falling pretty soon,   ’ always trouble   pipes.”

“Don’   today,” Gatsby answered. He turned   apologetically.
“You know, old sport, I’ never used  pool  summer?”

I looked   watch  stood .

“Twelve minutes   train.”

I ’ want  go   city. I ’ worth  decent stroke 
work,      —I ’ want  leave Gatsby. I
missed  train,   another,  I could get  away.

“I’ call  ,” I said finally.

“Do, old sport.”

“I’ call   noon.”

We walked slowly   steps.

“I suppose Daisy’ call .” He looked   anxiously,   
hoped I’ corroborate .

“I suppose .”

“Well, goodbye.”

We shook hands  I started away. Just  I reached  hedge I
remembered something  turned around.

“They’  rotten crowd,” I shouted across  lawn. “You’ worth 
whole damn bunch put together.”

I’ always  glad I said . It    compliment I ever
gave ,  I disapproved    beginning  end. First 
nodded politely,    face broke   radiant 
understanding smile,   ’   ecstatic cahoots   fact
  time. His gorgeous pink rag   suit made  bright spot 
colour   white steps,  I thought   night  I
first came   ancestral home, three months . The lawn 
drive   crowded   faces    guessed  
corruption—   stood   steps, concealing 
incorruptible dream,   waved  goodbye.

I thanked    hospitality. We  always thanking  
—I   others.

“Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Up   city, I tried     list  quotations  
interminable amount  stock,  I fell asleep   swivel-chair.
Just  noon  phone woke ,  I started   sweat
breaking    forehead. It  Jordan Baker;  often called 
   hour   uncertainty    movements 
hotels  clubs  private houses made  hard  find   
way. Usually  voice came   wire  something fresh  cool,
   divot   green golf-links  come sailing   
office window,   morning  seemed harsh  dry.

“I’ left Daisy’ house,”  said. “I’  Hempstead,  I’ going
  Southampton  afternoon.”

Probably    tactful  leave Daisy’ house,   act
annoyed ,   next remark made  rigid.

“You ’  nice   last night.”

“How could   mattered ?”

Silence   moment. Then:

“However—I want  see .”

“I want  see , .”

“Suppose I ’ go  Southampton,  come  town 
afternoon?”

“No—I ’ think  afternoon.”

“Very well.”

“It’ impossible  afternoon. Various—”

We talked like    ,   abruptly  ’ talking
 longer. I ’ know   us hung    sharp click,  I
know I ’ care. I ’  talked   across  tea-table
 day  I never talked      world.

I called Gatsby’ house   minutes later,   line  busy. I
tried four times; finally  exasperated central told   wire 
 kept open  long distance  Detroit. Taking  
timetable, I drew  small circle around  three-fifty train. Then I
leaned back   chair  tried  think. It   noon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I passed  ash-heaps   train  morning I  crossed
deliberately    side   car. I supposed ’  
curious crowd around   day  little boys searching  dark
spots   dust,   garrulous man telling    
 happened,   became less  less real even    
could tell   longer,  Myrtle Wilson’ tragic achievement 
forgotten. Now I want  go back  little  tell  happened 
 garage   left   night .

They  difficulty  locating  sister, Catherine. She must 
broken  rule  drinking  night,    arrived 
 stupid  liquor  unable  understand   ambulance 
already gone  Flushing. When  convinced   , 
immediately fainted,      intolerable part  
affair. Someone, kind  curious, took    car  drove  
 wake   sister’ body.

Until long  midnight  changing crowd lapped    front
  garage,  George Wilson rocked  back  forth 
 couch inside. For    door   office  open, 
everyone  came   garage glanced irresistibly  .
Finally someone said    shame,  closed  door. Michaelis
 several  men   ; first, four  five men, later
two  three men. Still later Michaelis   ask  last stranger
 wait  fifteen minutes longer,   went back   
place  made  pot  coffee. After ,  stayed  alone 
Wilson  dawn.

About three ’clock  quality  Wilson’ incoherent muttering
changed— grew quieter  began  talk   yellow car. He
announced     way  finding    yellow car
belonged ,    blurted    couple  months ago 
wife  come   city   face bruised   nose
swollen.

But   heard  say ,  flinched  began  cry “Oh,
 God!”    groaning voice. Michaelis made  clumsy attempt
 distract .

“How long    married, George? Come  , try  sit
still  minute,  answer  question. How long   
married?”

“Twelve years.”

“Ever   children? Come , George, sit still—I asked  
question. Did  ever   children?”

The hard brown beetles kept thudding   dull light, 
whenever Michaelis heard  car go tearing along  road outside 
sounded   like  car  ’ stopped   hours .
He ’ like  go   garage,   work bench 
stained   body   lying,   moved uncomfortably
around  office— knew every object    morning— 
time  time sat  beside Wilson trying  keep   quiet.

“Have  got  church  go  sometimes, George? Maybe even  
’     long time? Maybe I could call   church
 get  priest  come    could talk  , see?”

“Don’ belong  .”

“You ought    church, George,  times like . You must
 gone  church . Didn’  get married   church? Listen,
George, listen  . Didn’  get married   church?”

“That   long time ago.”

The effort  answering broke  rhythm   rocking—  moment
  silent. Then   half-knowing, half-bewildered look came
back   faded eyes.

“Look   drawer ,”  said, pointing   desk.

“Which drawer?”

“That drawer— one.”

Michaelis opened  drawer nearest  hand. There  nothing  
  small, expensive dog-leash, made  leather  braided
silver. It  apparently new.

“This?”  inquired, holding  .

Wilson stared  nodded.

“I found  yesterday afternoon. She tried  tell   ,  I
knew   something funny.”

“You mean  wife bought ?”

“She   wrapped  tissue paper   bureau.”

Michaelis ’ see anything odd  ,   gave Wilson  dozen
reasons   wife might  bought  dog-leash. But conceivably
Wilson  heard     explanations ,  Myrtle,
  began saying “Oh,  God!”    whisper— comforter
left several explanations   air.

“Then  killed ,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.

“Who ?”

“I   way  finding .”

“You’ morbid, George,” said  friend. “This    strain 
   ’ know  ’ saying. You’ better try  sit
quiet till morning.”

“He murdered .”

“It   accident, George.”

Wilson shook  head. His eyes narrowed   mouth widened
slightly   ghost   superior “Hm!”

“I know,”  said definitely. “I’ one   trusting fellas  I
’ think  harm  nobody,   I get  know  thing I know
. It   man   car. She ran   speak    
’ stop.”

Michaelis  seen  ,   ’ occurred    
  special significance  . He believed  Mrs. Wilson 
 running away   husband, rather  trying  stop 
particular car.

“How could    like ?”

“She’  deep one,” said Wilson,    answered  question.
“Ah-h-h—”

He began  rock ,  Michaelis stood twisting  leash  
hand.

“Maybe  got  friend  I could telephone , George?”

This   forlorn hope—  almost sure  Wilson   friend:
   enough     wife. He  glad  little later
  noticed  change   room,  blue quickening   window,
 realized  dawn ’ far . About five ’clock   blue
enough outside  snap   light.

Wilson’ glazed eyes turned    ash-heaps,  small grey
clouds took  fantastic shapes  scurried     
faint dawn wind.

“I spoke  ,”  muttered,   long silence. “I told  
might fool    ’ fool God. I took   
window”—  effort  got   walked   rear window 
leaned   face pressed  —“ I said ‘God knows 
’  , everything ’  . You may fool , 
 ’ fool God!’ ”

Standing behind , Michaelis saw   shock    looking 
 eyes  Doctor T. J. Eckleburg,    emerged, pale 
enormous,   dissolving night.

“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.

“That’  advertisement,” Michaelis assured . Something made 
turn away   window  look back   room. But Wilson
stood   long time,  face close   window pane, nodding
  twilight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By six ’clock Michaelis  worn ,  grateful   sound  
car stopping outside. It  one   watchers   night 
  promised  come back,   cooked breakfast  three, 
    man ate together. Wilson  quieter , 
Michaelis went home  sleep;   awoke four hours later 
hurried back   garage, Wilson  gone.

His movements—   foot   time— afterward traced 
Port Roosevelt    Gad’ Hill,   bought  sandwich 
 ’ eat,   cup  coffee. He must   tired 
walking slowly,   ’ reach Gad’ Hill  noon. Thus far
   difficulty  accounting   time—  boys 
 seen  man “acting sort  crazy,”  motorists    stared
oddly   side   road. Then  three hours  disappeared
 view. The police,   strength    said  Michaelis,
  “  way  finding ,” supposed   spent  time
going  garage  garage thereabout, inquiring   yellow car. On
  hand,  garage man   seen  ever came forward, 
perhaps    easier, surer way  finding    wanted 
know. By half-past two    West Egg,   asked someone 
way  Gatsby’ house. So   time  knew Gatsby’ name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At two ’clock Gatsby put   bathing-suit  left word  
butler   anyone phoned word    brought    
pool. He stopped   garage   pneumatic mattress  
amused  guests   summer,   chauffeur helped  
pump  . Then  gave instructions   open car ’  
taken    circumstances—   strange,  
front right fender needed repair.

Gatsby shouldered  mattress  started   pool. Once 
stopped  shifted   little,   chauffeur asked   
needed help,   shook  head    moment disappeared among
 yellowing trees.

No telephone message arrived,   butler went without  sleep
 waited    four ’clock— long    anyone
 give     came. I   idea  Gatsby  ’
believe  would come,  perhaps   longer cared. If  
true  must  felt    lost  old warm world, paid 
high price  living  long   single dream. He must 
looked    unfamiliar sky  frightening leaves  shivered
  found   grotesque thing  rose    raw  sunlight
 upon  scarcely created grass. A new world, material without
 real,  poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted
fortuitously  … like  ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward
   amorphous trees.

The chauffeur—  one  Wolfshiem’ protégés—heard 
shots—afterwards  could  say   ’ thought anything
much  . I drove   station directly  Gatsby’ house
  rushing anxiously   front steps   first thing 
alarmed anyone. But  knew , I firmly believe. With scarcely 
word said, four  us,  chauffeur, butler, gardener,  I hurried
   pool.

There   faint, barely perceptible movement   water  
fresh flow  one end urged  way toward  drain   .
With little ripples   hardly  shadows  waves,  laden
mattress moved irregularly   pool. A small gust  wind 
scarcely corrugated  surface  enough  disturb  accidental
course   accidental burden. The touch   cluster  leaves
revolved  slowly, tracing, like  leg  transit,  thin red
circle   water.

It    started  Gatsby toward  house   gardener
saw Wilson’ body  little way    grass,   holocaust 
complete.


                                  IX

After two years I remember  rest   day,   night 
 next day,    endless drill  police  photographers 
newspaper men     Gatsby’ front door. A rope stretched
across  main gate   policeman   kept   curious, 
little boys soon discovered   could enter   yard, 
  always     clustered open-mouthed  
pool. Someone   positive manner, perhaps  detective, used 
expression “madman”   bent  Wilson’ body  afternoon, 
 adventitious authority   voice set  key   newspaper
reports next morning.

Most   reports   nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,
eager,  untrue. When Michaelis’ testimony   inquest brought
 light Wilson’ suspicions   wife I thought  whole tale
would shortly  served   racy pasquinade— Catherine,  might
 said anything, ’ say  word. She showed  surprising amount
 character   —looked   coroner  determined eyes
  corrected brow  ,  swore   sister  never
seen Gatsby,   sister  completely happy   husband,
  sister     mischief whatever. She convinced
  ,  cried   handkerchief,    
suggestion     could endure. So Wilson  reduced  
man “deranged  grief”  order   case might remain  
simplest form. And  rested .

But   part   seemed remote  unessential. I found 
 Gatsby’ side,  alone. From  moment I telephoned news  
catastrophe  West Egg village, every surmise  ,  every
practical question,  referred  . At first I  surprised 
confused; ,   lay   house  ’ move  breathe 
speak, hour upon hour,  grew upon   I  responsible, 
 one else  interested—interested, I mean,   intense
personal interest   everyone   vague right   end.

I called  Daisy half  hour   found , called 
instinctively  without hesitation. But   Tom  gone away
early  afternoon,  taken baggage  .

“Left  address?”

“No.”

“Say  ’  back?”

“No.”

“Any idea   ? How I could reach ?”

“I ’ know. Can’ say.”

I wanted  get somebody  . I wanted  go   room 
 lay  reassure : “I’ get somebody  , Gatsby. Don’
worry. Just trust   I’ get somebody  —”

Meyer Wolfshiem’ name ’   phone book. The butler gave 
 office address  Broadway,  I called Information,   
time I   number   long  five,   one answered 
phone.

“Will  ring ?”

“I’ rung three times.”

“It’  important.”

“Sorry. I’ afraid  one’ .”

I went back   drawing-room  thought   instant  
 chance visitors,   official people  suddenly filled
. But, though  drew back  sheet  looked  Gatsby 
shocked eyes,  protest continued   brain:

“Look , old sport, ’ got  get somebody  . You’ got
 try hard. I ’ go   alone.”

Someone started  ask  questions,  I broke away  going
upstairs looked hastily   unlocked parts   desk—’
never told  definitely   parents  dead. But  
nothing—  picture  Dan Cody,  token  forgotten violence,
staring    wall.

Next morning I sent  butler  New York   letter  Wolfshiem,
 asked  information  urged   come    next
train. That request seemed superfluous  I wrote . I  sure
’ start   saw  newspapers,   I  sure ’  
wire  Daisy  noon— neither  wire  Mr. Wolfshiem
arrived;  one arrived except  police  photographers 
newspaper men. When  butler brought back Wolfshiem’ answer I began
   feeling  defiance,  scornful solidarity  Gatsby
    .

 Dear Mr. Carraway. This   one    terrible shocks 
  life   I hardly  believe     true  . Such 
 mad act   man   make us  think. I cannot come 
   I  tied     important business  cannot get
 mixed    thing . If   anything I    little
 later let  know   letter  Edgar. I hardly know  I  
 I hear   thing like    completely knocked  
 .

                               Yours truly

                             Meyer Wolfshiem

  hasty addenda beneath:

 Let  know   funeral etc   know  family  .

When  phone rang  afternoon  Long Distance said Chicago 
calling I thought  would  Daisy  last. But  connection came
   man’ voice,  thin  far away.

“This  Slagle speaking …”

“Yes?” The name  unfamiliar.

“Hell   note, ’ ? Get  wire?”

“There ’   wires.”

“Young Parke’  trouble,”  said rapidly. “They picked   
 handed  bonds   counter. They got  circular  New
York giving ’em  numbers  five minutes . What ’ know
 , hey? You never  tell   hick towns—”

“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look — ’ Mr.
Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’ dead.”

There   long silence    end   wire, followed  
exclamation …   quick squawk   connection  broken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think     third day   telegram signed Henry C. Gatz
arrived   town  Minnesota. It said    sender 
leaving immediately   postpone  funeral   came.

It  Gatsby’ father,  solemn old man,  helpless  dismayed,
bundled    long cheap ulster   warm September day. His
eyes leaked continuously  excitement,   I took  bag 
umbrella   hands  began  pull  incessantly   sparse
grey beard  I  difficulty  getting   coat. He  
 point  collapse,  I took    music-room  made 
sit   I sent  something  eat. But  ’ eat, 
 glass  milk spilled   trembling hand.

“I saw    Chicago newspaper,”  said. “It    
Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”

“I ’ know   reach .”

His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly   room.

“It   madman,”  said. “He must   mad.”

“Wouldn’  like  coffee?” I urged .

“I ’ want anything. I’  right , Mr.—”

“Carraway.”

“Well, I’  right . Where   got Jimmy?”

I took    drawing-room,   son lay,  left 
. Some little boys  come    steps   looking 
 hall;  I told    arrived,  went reluctantly
away.

After  little  Mr. Gatz opened  door  came ,  mouth
ajar,  face flushed slightly,  eyes leaking isolated 
unpunctual tears. He  reached  age  death  longer  
quality  ghastly surprise,    looked around    
first time  saw  height  splendour   hall   great
rooms opening      rooms,  grief began  
mixed   awed pride. I helped    bedroom upstairs;  
took   coat  vest I told    arrangements  
deferred   came.

“I ’ know  ’ want, Mr. Gatsby—”

“Gatz   name.”

“—Mr. Gatz. I thought  might want  take  body West.”

He shook  head.

“Jimmy always liked  better  East. He rose    position 
 East. Were   friend   boy’, Mr.—?”

“We  close friends.”

“He   big future  ,  know. He    young man,
    lot  brain power .”

He touched  head impressively,  I nodded.

“If ’  lived, ’    great man. A man like James J.
Hill. He’  helped build   country.”

“That’ true,” I said, uncomfortably.

He fumbled   embroidered coverlet, trying  take   
bed,  lay  stiffly— instantly asleep.

That night  obviously frightened person called ,  demanded 
know  I    would give  name.

“This  Mr. Carraway,” I said.

“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This  Klipspringer.”

I  relieved ,   seemed  promise another friend 
Gatsby’ grave. I ’ want      papers  draw 
sightseeing crowd,  I’  calling    people . They
 hard  find.

“The funeral’ tomorrow,” I said. “Three ’clock,    house.
I wish ’ tell anybody ’  interested.”

“Oh, I ,”  broke  hastily. “Of course I’  likely  see
anybody,   I .”

His tone made  suspicious.

“Of course ’   .”

“Well, I’ certainly try. What I called   —”

“Wait  minute,” I interrupted. “How  saying ’ come?”

“Well,  fact — truth   matter   I’ staying 
 people    Greenwich,   rather expect    
 tomorrow. In fact, ’  sort  picnic  something. Of
course I’   best  get away.”

I ejaculated  unrestrained “Huh!”   must  heard ,  
went  nervously:

“What I called     pair  shoes I left . I wonder 
’   much trouble    butler send  . You see,
’ tennis shoes,  I’ sort  helpless without . My
address  care  B. F.—”

I ’ hear  rest   name,  I hung   receiver.

After  I felt  certain shame  Gatsby—one gentleman   I
telephoned implied    got   deserved. However,  
 fault,    one    used  sneer  bitterly 
Gatsby   courage  Gatsby’ liquor,  I   known
better   call .

The morning   funeral I went   New York  see Meyer
Wolfshiem; I ’ seem  reach    way. The door  I
pushed open,   advice   elevator boy,  marked “The
Swastika Holding Company,”   first  ’ seem   anyone
inside. But  I’ shouted “hello” several times  vain, 
argument broke  behind  partition,  presently  lovely Jewess
appeared   interior door  scrutinized   black hostile
eyes.

“Nobody’ ,”  said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’ gone  Chicago.”

The first part    obviously untrue,  someone  begun 
whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.

“Please say  Mr. Carraway wants  see .”

“I ’ get  back  Chicago,  I?”

At  moment  voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’, called “Stella!”
   side   door.

“Leave  name   desk,”  said quickly. “I’ give   
  gets back.”

“But I know ’ .”

She took  step toward   began  slide  hands indignantly 
   hips.

“You young men think   force  way    time,” 
scolded. “We’ getting sickantired  . When I say ’  Chicago,
’  Chicago.”

I mentioned Gatsby.

“Oh-h!” She looked    . “Will  —What  
name?”

She vanished. In  moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly  
doorway, holding   hands. He drew    office, remarking
  reverent voice     sad time    us,  offered
  cigar.

“My memory goes back   first I met ,”  said. “A young major
    army  covered   medals  got   war.
He   hard     keep  wearing  uniform  
’ buy  regular clothes. First time I saw    
came  Winebrenner’ poolroom  Forty-third Street  asked  
job. He ’ eat anything   couple  days. ‘Come   
lunch  ,’ I said. He ate   four dollars’ worth  food
 half  hour.”

“Did  start   business?” I inquired.

“Start ! I made .”

“Oh.”

“I raised     nothing, right    gutter. I saw right
away    fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man,    told
    Oggsford I knew I could use  good. I got   join
 American Legion   used  stand high . Right   
 work   client  mine   Albany. We   thick like
  everything”— held  two bulbous fingers—“always together.”

I wondered   partnership  included  World’ Series
transaction  1919.

“Now ’ dead,” I said   moment. “You   closest friend,
 I know ’ want  come   funeral  afternoon.”

“I’ like  come.”

“Well, come .”

The hair   nostrils quivered slightly,    shook  head
 eyes filled  tears.

“I ’  —I ’ get mixed   ,”  said.

“There’ nothing  get mixed  . It’   .”

“When  man gets killed I never like  get mixed     
way. I keep . When I   young man   different—  friend
 mine died,  matter , I stuck     end. You may
think ’ sentimental,  I mean —  bitter end.”

I saw    reason      determined   come,
 I stood .

“Are   college man?”  inquired suddenly.

For  moment I thought   going  suggest  “gonnegtion,”  
 nodded  shook  hand.

“Let us learn  show  friendship   man    alive 
    dead,”  suggested. “After    rule   let
everything alone.”

When I left  office  sky  turned dark  I got back  West
Egg   drizzle. After changing  clothes I went next door  found
Mr. Gatz walking    excitedly   hall. His pride  
son    son’ possessions  continually increasing   
 something  show .

“Jimmy sent   picture.” He took   wallet  trembling
fingers. “Look .”

It   photograph   house, cracked   corners  dirty
 many hands. He pointed  every detail   eagerly. “Look
!”   sought admiration   eyes. He  shown  
often  I think    real      house .

“Jimmy sent   . I think ’   pretty picture. It shows 
well.”

“Very well. Had  seen  lately?”

“He come   see  two years ago  bought   house I live 
. Of course   broke    run   home,  I see
    reason  . He knew    big future  front 
. And ever since  made  success    generous  .”

He seemed reluctant  put away  picture, held   another
minute, lingeringly,   eyes. Then  returned  wallet 
pulled   pocket  ragged old copy   book called Hopalong
Cassidy.

“Look ,    book       boy. It  shows
.”

He opened    back cover  turned  around    see. On
 last flyleaf  printed  word schedule,   date September
12, 1906. And underneath:

“I came across  book  accident,” said  old man. “It 
shows , ’ ?”

“It  shows .”

“Jimmy  bound  get ahead. He always   resolves like 
 something. Do  notice  ’ got  improving  mind? He
 always great  . He told  I et like  hog ,  I beat
  .”

He  reluctant  close  book, reading  item aloud  
looking eagerly  . I think  rather expected   copy  
list    use.

A little  three  Lutheran minister arrived  Flushing, 
I began  look involuntarily   windows   cars. So 
Gatsby’ father. And   time passed   servants came  
stood waiting   hall,  eyes began  blink anxiously,  
spoke   rain   worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced
several times   watch,  I took  aside  asked   wait
 half  hour. But  ’  use. Nobody came.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

About five ’clock  procession  three cars reached  cemetery
 stopped   thick drizzle beside  gate—first  motor hearse,
horribly black  wet,  Mr. Gatz   minister    
limousine,   little later four  five servants   postman
 West Egg,  Gatsby’ station wagon,  wet   skin. As 
started   gate   cemetery I heard  car stop  
 sound  someone splashing  us   soggy ground. I
looked around. It   man  owl-eyed glasses  I  found
marvelling  Gatsby’ books   library one night three months
.

I’ never seen  since . I ’ know   knew  
funeral,  even  name. The rain poured   thick glasses, 
 took    wiped   see  protecting canvas unrolled
 Gatsby’ grave.

I tried  think  Gatsby    moment,    already
 far away,  I could  remember, without resentment, 
Daisy ’ sent  message   flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur
“Blessed   dead   rain falls ,”    owl-eyed
man said “Amen  ,”   brave voice.

We straggled  quickly   rain   cars. Owl-eyes spoke
    gate.

“I ’ get   house,”  remarked.

“Neither could anybody else.”

“Go !” He started. “Why,  God!  used  go   
hundreds.”

He took   glasses  wiped  , outside  .

“The poor son---bitch,”  said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One    vivid memories   coming back West  prep school
 later  college  Christmas time. Those  went farther 
Chicago would gather   old dim Union Station  six ’clock  
December evening,    Chicago friends, already caught  
  holiday gaieties,  bid   hasty goodbye. I remember
 fur coats   girls returning  Miss This--That’  
chatter  frozen breath   hands waving overhead   caught
sight  old acquaintances,   matchings  invitations: “Are 
going   Ordways’?  Herseys’?  Schultzes’?”   long
green tickets clasped tight   gloved hands. And last  murky
yellow cars   Chicago, Milwaukee  St. Paul railroad looking
cheerful  Christmas    tracks beside  gate.

When  pulled    winter night   real snow,  snow,
began  stretch  beside us  twinkle   windows, 
 dim lights  small Wisconsin stations moved ,  sharp wild
brace came suddenly   air. We drew  deep breaths    
walked back  dinner   cold vestibules, unutterably aware
  identity   country  one strange hour,  
melted indistinguishably   .

That’  Middle West—  wheat   prairies   lost Swede
towns,   thrilling returning trains   youth,   street
lamps  sleigh bells   frosty dark   shadows  holly
wreaths thrown  lighted windows   snow. I  part  , 
little solemn   feel   long winters,  little complacent
 growing    Carraway house   city  dwellings 
still called  decades   family’ name. I see   
   story   West,  —Tom  Gatsby, Daisy 
Jordan  I,   Westerners,  perhaps  possessed 
deficiency  common  made us subtly unadaptable  Eastern life.

Even   East excited  , even  I   keenly aware
  superiority   bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond 
Ohio,   interminable inquisitions  spared  
children    old—even    always    quality 
distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures    fantastic
dreams. I see    night scene  El Greco:  hundred houses, 
 conventional  grotesque, crouching   sullen, overhanging
sky   lustreless moon. In  foreground four solemn men  dress
suits  walking along  sidewalk   stretcher   lies 
drunken woman   white evening dress. Her hand,  dangles 
 side, sparkles cold  jewels. Gravely  men turn   
house— wrong house. But  one knows  woman’ name,   one
cares.

After Gatsby’ death  East  haunted   like , distorted
beyond  eyes’ power  correction. So   blue smoke  brittle
leaves    air   wind blew  wet laundry stiff  
line I decided  come back home.

There  one thing   done  I left,  awkward, unpleasant
thing  perhaps  better   let alone. But I wanted 
leave things  order    trust  obliging  indifferent
sea  sweep  refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker  talked  
around   happened  us together,    happened
afterward  ,   lay perfectly still, listening,   big
chair.

She  dressed  play golf,  I remember thinking  looked like
 good illustration,  chin raised  little jauntily,  hair 
colour   autumn leaf,  face   brown tint  
fingerless glove   knee. When I  finished  told  without
comment    engaged  another man. I doubted , though
  several  could  married   nod   head,  I
pretended   surprised. For   minute I wondered  I ’
making  mistake,  I thought     quickly  got 
 say goodbye.

“Nevertheless   throw  ,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw
    telephone. I ’ give  damn   ,  
  new experience  ,  I felt  little dizzy   .”

We shook hands.

“Oh,    remember”— added—“ conversation    
driving  car?”

“Why— exactly.”

“You said  bad driver   safe   met another bad driver?
Well, I met another bad driver, ’ I? I mean   careless  
 make   wrong guess. I thought   rather  honest,
straightforward person. I thought    secret pride.”

“I’ thirty,” I said. “I’ five years  old  lie   
call  honour.”

She ’ answer. Angry,  half  love  ,  tremendously
sorry, I turned away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One afternoon late  October I saw Tom Buchanan. He  walking ahead
  along Fifth Avenue   alert, aggressive way,  hands  
little   body    fight  interference,  head moving
sharply   , adapting    restless eyes. Just 
I slowed   avoid overtaking   stopped  began frowning 
 windows   jewellery store. Suddenly  saw   walked back,
holding   hand.

“What’  matter, Nick? Do  object  shaking hands  ?”

“Yes. You know  I think  .”

“You’ crazy, Nick,”  said quickly. “Crazy  hell. I ’ know
’  matter  .”

“Tom,” I inquired, “   say  Wilson  afternoon?”

He stared   without  word,  I knew I  guessed right 
 missing hours. I started  turn away,   took  step 
  grabbed  arm.

“I told   truth,”  said. “He came   door   
getting ready  leave,   I sent  word   ’ 
 tried  force  way upstairs. He  crazy enough  kill  
I ’ told   owned  car. His hand    revolver  
pocket every minute     house—” He broke  defiantly.
“What  I  tell ? That fellow   coming  . He threw
dust   eyes  like    Daisy’,     tough
one. He ran  Myrtle like ’ run   dog  never even
stopped  car.”

There  nothing I could say, except  one unutterable fact  
’ true.

“And   think I ’   share  suffering—look , 
I went  give   flat  saw  damn box  dog biscuits
sitting    sideboard, I sat   cried like  baby. By
God   awful—”

I ’ forgive   like ,  I saw     done
,  , entirely justified. It    careless 
confused. They  careless people, Tom  Daisy— smashed 
things  creatures   retreated back   money  
vast carelessness,  whatever    kept  together,  let
 people clean   mess   made …

I shook hands  ;  seemed silly  ,  I felt suddenly 
though I  talking   child. Then  went   jewellery
store  buy  pearl necklace— perhaps   pair  cuff
buttons—rid   provincial squeamishness forever.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gatsby’ house  still empty  I left— grass   lawn 
grown  long  mine. One   taxi drivers   village never
took  fare past  entrance gate without stopping   minute 
pointing inside; perhaps     drove Daisy  Gatsby  
East Egg  night   accident,  perhaps   made  story
    . I ’ want  hear   I avoided  
I got   train.

I spent  Saturday nights  New York   gleaming,
dazzling parties       vividly  I could still
hear  music   laughter, faint  incessant,   garden,
  cars going     drive. One night I  hear 
material car ,  saw  lights stop   front steps. But I
’ investigate. Probably    final guest    away
  ends   earth  ’ know   party  .

On  last night,   trunk packed   car sold   grocer,
I went   looked   huge incoherent failure   house 
. On  white steps  obscene word, scrawled   boy  
piece  brick, stood  clearly   moonlight,  I erased ,
drawing  shoe raspingly along  stone. Then I wandered   
beach  sprawled    sand.

Most   big shore places  closed     hardly 
lights except  shadowy, moving glow   ferryboat across 
Sound. And   moon rose higher  inessential houses began 
melt away  gradually I became aware   old island  
flowered   Dutch sailors’ eyes— fresh, green breast   new
world. Its vanished trees,  trees   made way  Gatsby’
house,   pandered  whispers   last  greatest

And  I sat  brooding   old, unknown world, I thought
